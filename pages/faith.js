          <p>
            Beliefs are very important. Some people call it their creed, dogma or position; but I
            call it doctrine. My belief in God, how He relates to us, and how we relate to Him are
            foundational in my teachings. I serve God as well as the people of His world
            wholeheartedly, based on the foundational teaching of the Bible, because it brings life
            worth-living.
          </p>

          <p>I believe that:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              There is one true God who is perfect, eternally existing in three persons - God the
              Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 5:48; Matthew
              28:19).
            </li>

            <li>
              Jesus Christ, who is God and the living Word, became flesh through His miraculous
              conception by the Holy Spirit and His virgin birth. Hence, He is perfect Deity and
              true humanity united in one Person forever (John 1:1, 14; Luke 1:34-38; Philippians
              2:6-11).
            </li>

            <li>
              He lived a sinless life and voluntarily atoned for the sins of men by dying on the
              cross as their substitute; the just for the unjust, thus satisfying divine justice and
              accomplishing salvation for all who trust in Him alone (Hebrews 4:15; Hebrews 2:9;
              Hebrews 9:28; 1 Peter 3:18).
            </li>

            <li>
              He arose from the dead in the same body according to the Scriptures (Acts 2:23-24).
            </li>

            <li>
              He ascended bodily into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God the Father, where
              He, the only mediator between God and man, continually makes intercession for His own
              (Hebrews 8:1).
            </li>

            <li>
              He will come again to establish His kingdom, righteousness and peace (Matthew 26:64).
            </li>

            <li>
              The Old and New Testaments, God's infallible written Word, is the sole basis of our
              beliefs. The Bible was uniquely, verbally and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit, and
              it was written without error (inerrant in the original manuscripts). It is the supreme
              and final authority in all matters on which it speaks because the final guide to the
              interpretation of Scripture is Scripture itself (2 Peter 1:20–21; 2 Timothy 3:15–16).
            </li>

            <li>
              Man was originally created in the image of God. He sinned by disobeying God; thus, he
              was alienated from his Creator. Due to that historic fall, all men are born by the
              sinful nature which results in both spiritual and physical death (Genesis 1:27; Romans
              3:23).
            </li>

            <li>
              Man's nature is corrupted, and he is thus totally unable to please God. Every man is
              in need of regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; 3:19).
            </li>

            <li>
              The salvation of man is wholly a work of God's free grace and is not the work,
              goodness or religious ceremony, in whole or in part of man. God imputes His
              righteousness to those who put their faith in Christ alone for their salvation, and
              are thereby justified in His sight (Romans 3:24; Romans 4; Romans 5:9-10, 18-19;
              Romans 11:5-6; Galatians 2:16-21; 5:4; Ephesians 2:8-9).
            </li>

            <li>
              Salvation has been provided through Jesus Christ for all men; and those who repent and
              believe in Him are born again of the Holy Spirit, receive the gift of eternal life,
              and become the children of God. This assurance is not based upon any kind of human
              merit, but is produced by the witness of the Holy Spirit, who confirms in the believer
              the testimony of God in His written Word (Titus 3:4-7).
            </li>

            <li>
              The Holy Spirit is a divine Person; He has come into the world to reveal and glorify
              Christ and to apply the saving work of Christ to men. He convicts and draws sinners to
              Christ, imparts new life to them, continually indwells them from the moment of
              spiritual birth and seals them until the day of redemption. His fullness, power and
              control are appropriated in the believer's life by faith (John 14:15-18; John 16:13;
              Acts 1:8).
            </li>

            <li>
              It is the will of God that each believer should be filled with the Holy Spirit, be
              separated from sin and the world, and be fully dedicated to the will of God. The
              believer is called to live in the power of the indwelling Spirit so that he will not
              fulfill the lust of the flesh but will bear fruit to the glory of God (1 Thessalonians
              5:23; Galatians 5:22-23).
            </li>

            <li>
              Jesus Christ is the Head of the Church, His Body, which is composed of all men, living
              and dead, who have been joined to Him through saving faith. We are members of one
              another (Ephesians 5:23; Romans 12:4-5; 1 Corinthians 6:15; 1 Corinthians 12:12-28;
              Ephesians 4:25; 5:30).
            </li>

            <li>
              God admonishes His people to assemble together regularly, which can be in groups or in
              the local church. This is a body of believers in Christ who are joined together for
              the worship of God, for edification through the Word of God, for prayer, fellowship,
              the proclamation of the gospel, mutual agreement and observance of the ordinances of
              baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Acts 2:41-47).
            </li>

            <li>
              The 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit as recorded in 1 Corinthians 12:7-10 are operational
              and effective today - wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, working of miracles,
              prophecy, discerning of spirits, diverse kinds of tongues and interpretation of
              tongues. These gifts belong to the Church and are manifested through individuals as
              the Spirit wills. They are bestowed on the believer, not by works but by grace; and
              even though they are distinctive, the individual can function in more than one of
              them.
            </li>

            <li>
              These gifts are irrevocable. They are without repentance, for God never withdraws them
              once they are given, and He does not change His mind about those to whom He gives His
              grace or to whom He sends His call (Romans 11:29).
            </li>

            <li>
              At physical death the believer enters immediately into eternal, conscious fellowship
              with the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting glory and
              blessing, while the unbeliever enters immediately into eternal, conscious separation
              from the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting judgment and
              condemnation (1 Corinthians 15:20-23; John 5:28-29).
            </li>

            <li>
              The Lord Jesus Christ commanded all believers to proclaim the Gospel throughout the
              world and to disciple men of every nation (Matthew 28:19-20).
            </li>

            <li>
              The second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is imminent and will be personal, visible,
              and premillennial to consummate history and the eternal plan of God (Hebrews 10:37;
              Luke 21:27).
            </li>

            <li>
              This is the believer’s blessed hope and is a vital truth which is an incentive to
              faithful service and the denial of ungodliness and worldly lusts (Titus 2:11-14).
