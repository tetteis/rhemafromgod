Hey! ðŸ‘‹

You're most welcome to my blog. I developed it purposely to reach out to "lost souls" and to help Christians grow in faith and increase in knowledge of God's Word. Whether you are a Christian or a seeker, you will find resources here to help you.

God's Word is the foundation for our spiritual growth and development. And He has made It accessible to us in diverse formats. He's faithful indeed! The Apostle Paul through the Holy Spirit admonishes us to be filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). It's God's perfect will for us to reign and live above the world's system of life. He wants us to break out of the status quo! The Lord says His children perish not because theyâ€™re not born again; they perish because they lack knowledge (Hosea 4:6).

The messages I share with you have deep understanding of the mystery of Christ. This mystery was never disclosed to human beings in past generations as it has now been revealed to God's children. This is in accordance with the terms of the eternal and timeless purpose which God has realized and carried into effect in the person of Christ Jesus our Lord, in Whom, because of our faith in Him, we dare to have the boldness (courage and confidence) of free access (an unreserved approach to God with freedom and without fear).

While here, I encourage you to make the best use of this site. Subscribe to the RSS feed, so you will be guided by receiving a ping every time there's something new on this site. Most people don't know about that, but try it out; it's a great service! Unless otherwise stated, all scriptures are taken from the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible.

Read the messages over and over until you're so filled with them. I love these words from the great man of faith, Smith Wigglesworth:

> Fill your head and your heart with the Scriptures... As you do this, you are sewing seeds that the Spirit of God can
> germinate... You must be so soaked with the Word of God, you must be so filled with it, that you yourself are a living
> epistle, known and read of all men. Believers are strong only as the Word of God abides in them. The Word of God is Spirit
> and life to those who receive it in simple faith... Know your Book, live it, believe it and obey it... If a thing is in the
> Bible it is so; it is not even to be prayed about; it is to be received and acted upon. Inactivity of faith is a robber
> which steals blessing.
