Welcome to my blog! I created it with the purpose of reaching out to "lost souls" and helping Christians grow in faith and knowledge of God's Word. Whether you're a believer or a seeker, you'll find resources here that can assist you in your spiritual journey.

God's Word is the foundation for our spiritual growth and development, and it's available to us in various forms. The Apostle Paul, through the Holy Spirit, urges us to be filled with the Spirit (Ephesians 5:18). It's God's perfect will for us to reign and live above the world's system of life, and He desires for us to break out of the status quo! The Lord says His children perish not because they're not born again, but because they lack knowledge (Hosea 4:6).

My messages have a deep understanding of the mystery of Christ. This mystery was never revealed to past generations of human beings, but it has now been disclosed to God's children. This is in line with the terms of the eternal and timeless purpose which God has accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord. As believers, we have the courage and confidence to have free access to God without fear.

While you're here, I encourage you to make the most of this site. Subscribe to the RSS feed so you can receive a notification every time there's new content. Most people don't know about this feature, but it's a great service! Unless otherwise stated, all Scriptures are from the King James Version (KJV) of the Bible.

Read the messages over and over until you're filled with them. As the great man of faith, Smith Wigglesworth, once said,

> "Fill your head and your heart with the Scriptures... As you do this, you are sewing seeds that the Spirit of God can germinate... You must be so soaked with the Word of God, you must be so filled with it, that you yourself are a living epistle, known and read of all men."

Believers are strong only as the Word of God abides in them. The Word of God is Spirit and life to those who receive it in simple faith... Know your Book, live it, believe it, and obey it. If something is in the Bible, it's so; it's not even something to pray about; it's to be received and acted upon. Inactivity of faith is a robber that steals blessings.
