### STEP #1: Understand that God's desire for you is life, abundant, and eternal.

In John 10:10, Jesus proclaimed that He came to give abundant life to those who follow Him. Ever since humanity's fall, God has yearned for a deep connection with humans and for them to reclaim the life He initially gave them. God accomplished this by sending His Son as the ultimate sacrifice: "For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life" (John 3:16). God longs for fellowship and companionship with people, and it is a tremendous gift that He has granted us. However, despite God's provision of an abundant and eternal life through His Son, many do not experience it. The second step holds the answer.

### STEP #2: Realize that you are separated from God.

Mankind is separated from God due to their selfish choices and disobedience, creating a gap between them. Although God has provided a way for humans to obtain an abundant and eternal life, sin continues to cause division from the Father. Sin results in death, as stated in Proverbs 14:12, "There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death." Isaiah 59:2 also says, "But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear." Additionally, Romans 3:23 declares, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," and Romans 6:23 states, "For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord."

There are those who believe they can attain righteousness through their own works and do not need Jesus. However, Romans 10:3 clarifies that those who strive to establish their own righteousness are ignorant of God's righteousness and do not submit to it. Despite having wealth, fame, success, or morality, individuals still experience a sense of emptiness, attempting to fill it with material possessions or religion. Only through Jesus can one obtain righteousness before God and fill that void.

### STEP #3: Accept the fact that God has provided only one solution to sin and separation from Himself.

Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is the only means of reconciliation to the Father and salvation. As stated in Acts 4:12, "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved." Despite searching for alternate solutions or worshipping different deities, only Jesus, who died for our sins and conquered death, bridges the divide between God and humanity. Romans 5:8 affirms that Christ's death demonstrates God's love for us, as He died for us while we were still sinners.

1 Peter 3:18 further clarifies that Christ, who suffered as a just man for the unjust, brings us to God. As per 1 Timothy 2:5, there is only one mediator between God and humans, which is Jesus Christ. Jesus Himself claimed in John 14:6, "I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me." Through His sacrifice on the cross, bloodshed, and resurrection, Jesus paid for our rebellion and sin against God and reconciled us with the Father.

### STEP #4: Get ready to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour.

Trusting in Christ alone can restore your relationship with God and bring you back to Him. It's an incredible exchange where you give Him your worst, and He gives you His best. This demonstrates how much God loves us, and the first step is to invite Jesus Christ into your heart to be your Lord and Savior, and to take away your sins. The Bible says, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me" (Revelation 3:20).

The Bible is clear that "if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9). Are you willing to let go of your burdens and sins and turn away from them? Are you ready to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior right now? Remember, you cannot carry your sins and burdens alone. That's why God the Father provided the perfect atonement for our sins so that we don't have to carry them anymore. Don't wait too long, because someday it might be too late.

### STEP #5: Pray to Receive Jesus Christ into your life.

You can pray the most crucial prayer of your life right now. Simply say:

> "O Lord God, I have faith in Jesus Christ, your Son who sacrificed himself for me and was resurrected from the dead to justify me. Your Word states in Romans 10:9-10, 'If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved.' Therefore, I confess that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day forward. I trust that you will return to earth again. I belong to you now and forever, and I will serve and follow you for the rest of my life. I renounce the world and the enemy of my soul. I receive remission of sins for my soul, and I receive eternal life into my spirit. I am saved! I am born again! Thank you for adopting me as your child."
