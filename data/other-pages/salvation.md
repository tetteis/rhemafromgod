### STEP #1: Understand that God's desire for you is life, abundant, and eternal.

Jesus said, "I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly" (John 10:10). Since the fall of man, God has always wanted to have a deep relationship with him. He wanted man to get back the kind of life He gave him after creation. God achieved His plan by sending a supreme sacrifice in the person of His Son: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16). God desires fellowship and companionship with you. What a wonderful gift the Father has given, yet if God gave His own Son to provide an abundant and everlasting life, why don’t more people have what He has designed for us to receive? We get the answer from step two.

### STEP #2: Realize that you are separated from God.

There is a gap between God and mankind. He has provided a way for us to receive an abundant and eternal life, but people throughout the ages have made selfish choices to disobey God Almighty whereas these choices continue to cause separation from the Father. God’s Word shows us that the result of sin is death. He says in His Word: "There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death" (Proverbs 14:12). God also said, "But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear" (Isaiah 59:2). Paul the Apostle states in Romans 3:23: “For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.” We also read from Romans 6:23: “For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."

Some people think they can become righteous by their works, so receiving Jesus is really not necessary. Read what the Bible says, “For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God” (Romans 10:23). Every day we hear of people who are rich, famous, achievers, star athletes - people who seem to have the best life can offer - yet they try to fill that empty void in their lives with "things". They even try good works, morality, and religion. Yet they remain empty, for only God, through His Son, can fill that emptiness. It’s only in Jesus that a person can become righteous before God.

### STEP #3: Accept the fact that God has provided only one solution to sin and separation from Himself.

Jesus Christ, the Son, is the only way to God; only He can reconcile us to the Father, and it’s only through Him that we can be saved. The Bible says, “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 14:12, NIV). Mankind may seek other solutions and worship other gods, but Jesus Christ, alone, died on the Cross for our sins and rose in triumph over the grave and eternal death. He paid the penalty for our sin and bridged the gap between God and mankind. The Bible explains: "But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8).

We are also told, "For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God" (1 Peter 3:18). There is only one way provided: "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus" (1 Timothy 2:5). Jesus declared: "...I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me" (John 14:6). Jesus Christ paid the penalty for our sin and rebellion against God by dying on the cross, shedding His blood, and rising from the dead to justify and reconcile us back to God the Father.

### STEP #4: Get ready to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour.

You can be brought back to God, and your relationship with Him can be restored by trusting in Christ alone to save your life from destruction. What an incredible exchange: Your worst for God's best!  This shows how God loves us, and this step begins by asking Jesus Christ to take away your sin and come into your heart to be your Lord and Saviour. God's Word is very clear: "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me" (Revelation 3:20).

The Bible tells us, "That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved" (Romans 10:9). Are you willing to let go of your burdens and sins?  Are you willing to turn away and repent of your sins?  Are you willing to receive Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour now? Remember you can never carry your sins and your burdens by yourself. That's why God the Father made the perfect atonement for our sins so that you carry your burden no more. Someday it might be too late!

### STEP #5: Pray to Receive Jesus Christ into your life.

At this moment you can pray the most important prayer of your life by simply saying:

> O Lord God, I believe in Jesus Christ, your Son who died for me and was raised from the dead for my justification. Your Word says in Romans 10:9-10 "...that if thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shall be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Therefore, I confess Jesus Christ as Lord of my life from this day forth. I believe You are coming back again to earth. I am Yours forever, and I will serve You and follow You the rest of my days. From this moment on, I belong to You only. I no longer belong to this world, or to the enemy of my soul. I belong to You. I receive remission of sins for my soul and I receive eternal life into my spirit. I am saved! I am born again! Thank you for making me your child.
