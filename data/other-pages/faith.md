Beliefs hold great significance in one's life. While some refer to it as their creed, dogma, or position, I prefer to call it doctrine. My teaching is built upon the fundamental beliefs of God, how He interacts with us, and our relationship with Him. I am dedicated to wholeheartedly serving both God and the people of His world, grounded in the core teachings of the Bible. This is because the Bible offers a fulfilling and purposeful life.

Our beliefs are as follows:

1. There is one perfect true God, eternally existing in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit (Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 5:48; Matthew 28:19).

2. Jesus Christ, who is God and the living Word, was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of a virgin. He is perfect Deity and true humanity united in one Person forever (John 1:1, 14; Luke 1:34-38; Philippians 2:6-11).

3. He lived a sinless life and voluntarily died on the cross as a substitute for the sins of mankind, satisfying divine justice and accomplishing salvation for all who trust in Him alone (Hebrews 4:15; Hebrews 2:9; Hebrews 9:28; 1 Peter 3:18).

4. He was resurrected from the dead in the same body according to the Scriptures (Acts 2:23-24).

5. He ascended bodily into heaven and is seated at the right hand of God the Father. He is the only mediator between God and man, and continually intercedes for His followers (Hebrews 8:1).

6. He will return to establish His kingdom, righteousness, and peace (Matthew 26:64).

7. The Old and New Testaments are God's infallible written Word, the sole basis of our beliefs. The Bible was uniquely, verbally, and fully inspired by the Holy Spirit and written without error (inerrant in the original manuscripts). It is the supreme and final authority in all matters on which it speaks, and the final guide to interpreting Scripture is Scripture itself (2 Peter 1:20–21; 2 Timothy 3:15–16).

8. Man was created in the image of God but sinned by disobeying God, alienating himself from his Creator. All people are born with a sinful nature that leads to spiritual and physical death (Genesis 1:27; Romans 3:23).

9. Due to man's corrupted nature, he is totally unable to please God and needs regeneration and renewal by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38; 3:19).

10. Salvation is wholly a work of God's free grace and cannot be achieved through man's goodness, works, or religious ceremonies. God imputes His righteousness to those who put their faith in Christ alone for salvation, justifying them in His sight (Romans 3:24; Romans 4; Romans 5:9-10, 18-19; Romans 11:5-6; Galatians 2:16-21; 5:4; Ephesians 2:8-9).

11. Salvation is available to all through Jesus Christ, and those who repent and believe in Him are born again of the Holy Spirit, receive eternal life, and become children of God. This assurance is produced by the witness of the Holy Spirit, who confirms the testimony of God in His written Word (Titus 3:4-7).

12. The Holy Spirit is a divine Person who reveals and glorifies Christ and applies His saving work to humanity. He convicts and draws sinners to Christ, imparts new life to them, continually indwells them from the moment of spiritual birth, and seals them until the day of redemption. The believer's life is controlled by faith in His fullness and power (John 14:15-18; John 16:13; Acts 1:8).

13. Every believer must be filled with the Holy Spirit, separated from sin and the world, and fully dedicated to God's will. Through the power of the indwelling Spirit, believers can resist the temptation of the flesh and produce fruit that glorifies God (1 Thessalonians 5:23; Galatians 5:22-23).

14. The Church, the Body of Christ, is comprised of all individuals, living and deceased, who have been united with Him through saving faith. We are interconnected as members of one another (Ephesians 5:23; Romans 12:4-5; 1 Corinthians 6:15; 1 Corinthians 12:12-28; Ephesians 4:25; 5:30).

15. God instructs His people to gather together frequently, whether in groups or in a local church. This body of believers comes together for the purpose of worshipping God, receiving instruction through His Word, praying, fellowshipping, sharing the Gospel, and observing the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Acts 2:41-47).

16. The 9 gifts of the Holy Spirit recorded in 1 Corinthians 12:7-10 are still active today. These gifts include wisdom, knowledge, faith, healing, working of miracles, prophecy, discerning of spirits, diverse kinds of tongues, and interpretation of tongues. They are given to the Church and manifested through individuals according to the Spirit's will. These gifts are not earned but are graciously bestowed upon believers, and individuals may operate in more than one gift.

17. These gifts are permanent, for God never withdraws them once He has given them, and He does not revoke His grace or call on those to whom He has given it (Romans 11:29).

18. When a believer dies, he immediately enters into conscious fellowship with the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting glory and blessing. In contrast, an unbeliever immediately enters into conscious separation from the Lord and awaits the resurrection of his body to everlasting judgment and condemnation (1 Corinthians 15:20-23; John 5:28-29).

19. All believers are commanded by Jesus Christ to share the Gospel with the entire world and make disciples of people from every nation (Matthew 28:19-20).

20. The second coming of Jesus Christ is imminent and will be personal, visible, and premillennial, marking the culmination of history and God's eternal plan (Hebrews 10:37; Luke 21:27).

21. This event is the believer's blessed hope and serves as a crucial incentive for faithful service and the rejection of ungodliness and worldly desires (Titus 2:11-14).
