Hey there! üëã

I'm Tettei Shahday-Annang. Gloria's husband, Kester's dad and Sir Laydrown's kid. I'm a born again Christian and full of the Holy Ghost. I absolutely believe in God and His Son Jesus Christ. I was born to a Muslim dad and a Christian mom whom I cherish so much. I know it's surprising how a Muslim and a Christian came together, but that baffles me too. Well, although I have earthly parents, my Bible lets me know that my origin is in Christ and I come from Zion, the City of God (John 1:13; James 1:18; Hebrews 12:22). You can check out my [Statement of Faith](https://www.rhemafromgod.com/faith) to find out about my beliefs.

My life totally changed when I went to live with grandma in Winneba üòç. Even though she's illiterate, she's just brilliant! She used to tell me more about God as well as the miracles the Lord wrought by her hands. She has such great faith, and I'm a living testimony of that. I had my primary education while living with her, after which I came back to mom in Tema to further my education. I got used to computers in Junior High School, which gave me access to order Christian materials online to study.

I developed so much passion for God's Word such that I wouldn't let the day pass without reading it. When I found tracts in the street, no matter how dirty they were, I'd pick them to read. I‚Äôve been truly blessed by those who sponsor ministry materials to be distributed to people across the globe. I‚Äôm saying this because I know certain individuals paid for the materials I received by post. The Lord is their primary source, and they'll never run dry. As the Bible declares, "...God loves (He takes pleasure in, prizes above other things, and is unwilling to abandon or to do without) a cheerful (joyous, "prompt to do it") giver [whose heart is in his giving]" (2 Corinthians 9:7, AMP).

Don‚Äôt think you're wasting your money when asked to help sponsor the Gospel. I remember the Lord speaking to me as a kid. Whenever He did, He'd say: "Be anxious for nothing!" I found comfort in the Words of the Lord and my life has never been the same. I will never stop teaching the Word of my Maker. We're taking the Gospel and the divine presence of God to the nations of the earth in demonstration of the Holy Ghost and power! üî•‚ö°

I want to encourage you today. Listen, it doesn‚Äôt matter where you find yourself today. God can turn things around for your good. You‚Äôre not a mistake! God has a plan and purpose for you and that is the very reason why you are alive today. Don't dwell on your feelings; don‚Äôt see yourself the way others see you. Get the true picture of yourself by studying the Bible - it's your mirror! (2 Corinthians 3:18). Consciously and continuously meditate on what God has said about you in His Word until it settles down in your spirit, and until your inner man becomes fully aware of who you are.

I invite your to as your Lord and personal [accept Jesus Christ](https://www.rhemafromgod.com/salvation) Saviour if you have already not done so.

If you just accepted the Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Saviour, congratulations!!! You are now a child of God!

Believe it, for the Word of God always WORKS!

I Love You.

God bless you!
