Greetings!

My name is Tettei Shahday-Annang, and I am a born again Christian who is filled with the Holy Ghost. I am married to Gloria and blessed with 2 sons. [Sir Laydrown](https://web.facebook.com/laydrownone) is my godfather, whom I cherish greatly. Despite being born to a Muslim father and Christian mother, my faith in God and belief in His Son, Jesus Christ, is unwavering. My origin is in Christ, and I come from Zion, the City of God (John 1:13; James 1:18; Hebrews 12:22). You can learn more about my beliefs by checking out my [Statement of Faith](/about).

Growing up with my grandma in Winneba, I learned more about God and the miracles He can perform through the faith of His people. I developed a passion for studying God's Word and would read it every day. Even dirty tracts found in the street were not spared from my desire to learn. I have been blessed by those who have sponsored ministry materials to be distributed globally, and I know that their generosity is pleasing to God (2 Corinthians 9:7, AMP).

If you are feeling lost or uncertain about your purpose, I want to encourage you to seek the truth in the Bible. You are not a mistake, and God has a plan for you. Through Jesus Christ, you can become a child of God and experience the blessings that come with that relationship. Don't let your feelings or the opinions of others define who you are. Instead, meditate on what God has said about you in His Word until you fully understand your true identity (2 Corinthians 3:18).

If you have recently [accepted Jesus Christ](/salvation) as your Lord and personal Savior, congratulations! You are now a child of God, and His Word will always work for you. I encourage you to find a Holy Ghost-filled, Bible-believing church in your area and become a part of the community. And if you need any help, feel free to write to us or follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rhemafromgod).

God bless you!
