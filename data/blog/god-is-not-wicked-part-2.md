A man tests positive for HIV and starts to fear, but it is not the virus that kills him, it is fear. We should face our problems with knowledge of the Word of God, as every problem has a solution. God has compassion for all of His creation and those who believe in Him will be blessed with every spiritual blessing. As believers, we are seated with Christ at the right hand of God, and we need to be conscious of our position in Him and study the Word of God (Ephesians 2:6; Job 23:12; Matthew 4:4). Fear is having faith in the works of the devil, but nothing can separate us from the love of God.

This is the testimony of a woman (Sister Chinyere). She had a beautiful flight to Abuja, Nigeria, but couldn't land in Lagos due to a queue. The pilot returned to Abuja due to fuel concerns but encountered a terrible storm. She took charge and made declarations, speaking to the winds, the aircraft, and the clouds, declaring peace. After some time, the turbulence stopped, and the passengers thanked her for saving their lives. As a Christian, you have the divine life, and nothing can separate you from God's love. Speak to your problems, and command them out of your way by stirring up your faith through studying the Word of God (Mark 11:23).

God loves us even in the deepest ocean! Don't fret in boisterous water; you're soaked in God's love. Jonah survived three days and nights in a fish's belly and Jesus walked on water, teaching us to keep our eyes fixed on Him (Jonah 1; 2; John 6:16-20). He is always with us, even in the toughest times. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire unscathed, and Daniel survived the den of lions because he believed in God (Daniel 3:24-27; Daniel 6:1-27). Let us believe in God and His power to deliver us from harm.

Take comfort in this declaration from God: "When you go through deep waters and great trouble, I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown! When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you" (Isaiah 43:2, NLT). Your limitations are unreal; they have no foundation! Remember, "the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal" (2 Corinthians 4:18). Greater is He that lives in us than He that's in the world (1 John 4:4). The Holy Spirit living in you is God living in you. God knew you even before you were formed in your mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:5). He will never abandon you; He has inscribed you upon the palms of His hands (Isaiah 49:15-16).

Don't rely on people who can disappoint; trust in the Almighty God who never fails (Romans 11:29). Walk in the light of His Word and count it joy when faced with challenges (James 1:2), for God's promises are irrevocable (Romans 11:29). He is able to make all grace come to you in abundance (2 Corinthians 9:8). Keep a vision of the good things God has for you and be a blessing to others (Genesis 15:5). Study the Word to know His plan for your life.

God has good plans for us (Jeremiah 29:11). The earth belongs to the Lord and everything in it (Psalms 24:1; 1 Corinthians 10:26). As heirs of God (Romans 8:17), we must understand that religion cannot limit God's blessings in our lives. Our theology must be combined with revelation, obtained from reading the Word of God, to receive God's blessings. Abraham trusted God and did not worry when Lot chose the best land (Genesis 13:14-15,17). We must lift up our eyes and see ourselves where we want to be. We must think positively and change negative thoughts with the Word of God. Let us hold on to the Word of God and wait for His blessings. And above all, let us receive Jesus Christ as our Lord and personal Saviour to experience the fullness of His blessings. God bless you!
