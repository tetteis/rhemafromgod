God is good and as we increase in grace, we come to know His goodness. To enjoy God's freely given promises, we need knowledge and the rhema of God - the spoken word from scripture for the present moment (1 Corinthians 3:21). The devil opposes revelation knowledge, but we must come to God with the faith of a child, accepting His promises (Matthew 18:3-4). Christ holds all wisdom and knowledge, and we are complete in Him (Colossians 2:3,9,10). Preaching the Word brings signs and wonders. We must be careful what we read and listen to, as it affects us. We must lay hold of God's overflowing grace and reign as kings in life through Jesus Christ (Romans 5:17).

The immeasurable grace of God determines the level of the glory of God you can function in, marking the difference between mature and immature believers. To grow in grace and knowledge, we need to come to know Jesus better. Grace and peace go together, and the more grace you have, the more peace you can enjoy. Growing in grace requires precise and correct knowledge of God and Jesus Christ. To walk in ever-increasing grace, our minds must align with the Word of God (2 Corinthians 10:5; Romans 12:2). We were once slaves to the law, but now we are God's own sons (Galatians 4:1-7, TLB). To come to maturity, we must grow with the Word of God. There is no situation too big enough to hold you down when you're equipped with knowledge.

Strengthen your faith with the Word for the evil day (Ephesians 6:13). Don't give up on God, there's hope in Christ. "Rhema" is the spoken Word (Hebrews 11:3). "Aion" refers to the structure and administration of your life (Strong's #165). "Katartizo" means "to repair," "to mend," "to put in order," "to fit out," or "to perfect" (Strong's #2675). God framed the world from His spoken Word (John 1:1). "Logos" refers to the Word of God on the pages of your Bible (John 1:1). Testify to people that you're healed and believe the Word of God over men (1 Peter 2:24).

The Bible reveals that before God spoke, the world was chaotic, and His Spirit brooded over the waters. Through His spoken Word, God brought everything into being. The Word of God, both logos and rhema, is powerful and effective when applied. The potency of God's Word is described in Isaiah 55, where He declares that His Word accomplishes His purposes. Jesus demonstrated the power of the spoken Word when He cursed the fig tree, and it withered (Mark 11:12-25). He encouraged His disciples to have faith in God and speak to their mountains with the same authority, believing that they would receive what they ask for. We are called to have the faith of God and speak the Word of Faith over every situation until it manifests.

According to Hebrews 11:1 (AMP), faith is the assurance of things hoped for and the proof of things not seen. It is like a title deed that proves we have what we claim to have. We can declare healing even if symptoms are present because God has given us great promises in His Word (2 Peter 1:4). It is our responsibility to walk in the light of these promises and speak the Word of God, which releases the power of God in our lives (2 Peter 1:4). To see this power in action, we must confess the Word of God and not our experiences or challenges.

Rhema is powerful, but it must be spoken to create change in your life. Speak the Word of God constantly to create the right atmosphere and release the power of God in your life. Rhema is the Word of God spoken into your life, releasing creative energy and strength. Education is not the key to success; your words have the power to shape your destiny. Don't blame God for your misfortunes; take control of your future by declaring God's Word.
