As God's children, we should exemplify Christ's character and strive for peace with everyone. By studying God's Word, we are transformed into His image. To bear fruit after Jesus' likeness, we must remain in Him and fill our spirit with the Scriptures. As Smith Wigglesworth said, we must be soaked in God's Word to become a living epistle, exhibiting the fruits of love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. (Romans 12:18, NLT; 2 Corinthians 3:18, ESV; John 15:5; Galatians 5:22-23)

By filling your heart and mind with the Word of God, the fruits of the Spirit are evident in your life, and your character can preach the Gospel to unbelievers. It's important to submit to authority and show respect to live in peace. Even if you disagree with the ruling government, you should still pay your taxes and speak kindly of them when appropriate. As established by God, those who rebel against authority bring judgment on themselves. (Galatians 5:22-23; Romans 13:1-2)

Obey rulers and authorities by doing what is right, for they are God's servants to punish wrongdoers. Pay taxes, show respect, and cultivate humility, kindness, and forgiveness (Romans 13:1-7). "Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger... Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you" (Ephesians 4:31-32). Follow Stephen's example of forgiveness and pray for those who persecute you.

Stephen's prayer before his death likely prepared Saul's salvation, who later became Paul and wrote several books of the New Testament. Let's pray for our enemies, as God may use them for the furtherance of His Gospel. As Christians, let's focus on our belief in Christ and avoid negative comments about other men of God. Be content with what you have and don't worry about recognition or greetings from others. Learn from the lives of those praised in the Bible, such as John who said "He must increase, but I must decrease" (John 3:30).

In the Book of Esther 3, Mordecai refused to bow down to prince Haman due to his pride. Prince Haman wanted to kill Mordecai, but the Lord stopped him. True character includes humility, and those who are proud because of their possessions gain nothing (James 4:6). Don't worry about your position in life, for God's promotion does not come from the force of men (1 Peter 5:5-6). Be humble and trust in God's promises. Jesus, though God, humbled Himself and became a servant, obedient even to death on the cross (Philippians 2:7-8). Let us also humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God, and He will exalt us in due time.

Share what you have with others and support God's Word through giving. Grow quickly in your faith and feed your Spirit with God's Word. The poor in Spirit (Matthew 5:3) have given up everything for others and the spread of the gospel. Mourning in Matthew 5:4 refers to mourning and interceding for others in prayer. Choose to be humble and honor all men, love the brotherhood, fear God, and honor the king.

Think on things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, of good report, virtuous, and praiseworthy.
