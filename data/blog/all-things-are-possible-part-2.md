At times, we wonder why God is silent on us. But we must put His Word to work, as it is truth and reliable. Abraham's faith did not weaken, even when he faced physical and natural evidence that challenged God's promise of a child. He considered only what God had said to him, not his problems. That's what faith is. (John 17:17, 1 Kings 8:56, Joshua 21:45, Romans 4:19-20, Psalm 1)

When the twelve spies returned, ten gave a negative report and died, but Caleb and Joshua had faith and were praised by God (Numbers 14:24). Faith doesn't rely on natural perspectives, but on God's will (2 Timothy 1:7). Fear is a spirit that can attack and weaken faith. Declare healing based on God's Word (Isaiah 53:5; 1 Peter 2:24), which states that Jesus took our sickness and disease (Isaiah 53:4).

Matthew 8:17 says that Jesus took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses. So, we should proclaim our divine health and speak God's Word over our problems. Caleb and Joshua were truth-bearers because they believed God's promises (Hebrews 11:1-2). Faith gives substance to hope and is the title deed to what we believe (Romans 4:18, 21-22). The Word of God is our witness, and everything else is a lie

Smith Wigglesworth's story is an example of standing on God's Word for healing. He had faith in God's power to break up his kidney stones, even when the doctors were skeptical. It took three years of pain and bleeding, but he trusted in God. Caleb and Joshua believed in God's promise to give them the land and saw the giants as easily overcome. Our faith is important and we should hold onto God's Word in times of adversity. The Bible teaches that without faith, it's impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6). The elders in the Old Testament received a good report from God because of their faith, not just their love, prayer, holiness, or righteousness. Faith is necessary to activate blessings from God. Abraham's faith allowed him to trust God even when he was asked to sacrifice his only son, Isaac (Hebrews 11:19). And God rewarded his faith by saving Isaac from the altar.

Faith is about obeying God's instructions promptly to please Him. Abraham's faith in God's Word made him "the father of faith" and "the friend of God." We are also called to live the faith life as Christians, and Hebrews 11 lists great men of faith. Everything in the Kingdom of God operates by faith, not holiness or righteousness. Without faith, we can't succeed in our jobs, business, family, academics, finances, health, or ministry, nor can we overcome the devil or respond well to our enemies. Instead, we should love, bless, and pray for them (Matthew 5:44; Luke 6:28).

To respond rightly to Jesus' command to love and bless our enemies, we need faith. Criticisms can make us stronger if our faith is strong. We must live a faith lifestyle, as it is the only way for Christians to succeed. Sin is not the reason why God doesn't answer prayers, for Jesus dealt with sin (Romans 6:6-7). Sin shall not have dominion over us. Satan uses sin-consciousness to keep Christians in bondage. Every true child of God desires to live right and come out of anything that's wrong. God sees us as holy, unblameable, and unreproveable (Colossians 1:21-22). Being born again is by faith. The kingdom of God is not based on feelings but on the truth of God's Word (Luke 17:20). We must accept the truth about ourselves as God says.

Understand that Jesus died for your sins, giving you a new life that's superior to Satan. Renew your mind through the Word of God to deal with guilt (2 Timothy 2:1). Jesus paid the penalty for your sins, so trust in Him, not your own abilities or qualifications (Colossians 1:12; Ephesians 2:8-9; 2 Corinthians 5:21). As a born-again believer, you're as righteous as God, and can receive His best. Believe and receive when you pray, and act like you've already received it.

According to Rev Chris Oyakhilome PhD, prayer is not for reminding God of your needs or complaining about your troubles. Instead, approach prayer with the knowledge that you have already received what you ask for and maintain a positive attitude of faith. Remember to have a "I've got it consciousness" (1 John 5:14-15) and recognize the power of your prayers (James 5:16). God has already given us everything we need for a successful life (2 Peter 1:3), and it's our responsibility to meditate on and personalize His Word to receive its blessings.

Speak and act like you already have what you asked for, and thank the Lord for it. Long prayers or vain repetitions won't move God; it's your faith that matters (Matthew 6:7). Believe and receive God's Word as the only truth, and speak it over your situation to receive its benefits.
