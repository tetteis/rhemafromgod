The Apostle urges the saints to experience the love of Christ, be filled with God's presence and become fully immersed in Him (Ephesians 3:19). By receiving revelation knowledge from God, we awaken to our true selves and live the all-conquering life that God has placed within us. Through prayerful study and meditation on God's Word, the Spirit of the Lord ministers to us with spiritual realities. As Christ's Church, we have all that He has, and God has put all things under Christ's authority for our benefit (Ephesians 1:22). Therefore, the devil has no power over us, and trials are opportunities for growth.

James 1:2-4 says to consider trials as joy because they develop patience, maturity, and completeness. God allows challenges, but He loves us and knows we can overcome them. Trials come to make us stronger and perfect, and Paul even rejoiced in his tribulations (Romans 5:3; 2 Corinthians 12:7-9). Our enemy Satan seeks to devour us, but God's eyes are watching and ready to show His strength for those who are perfect in heart towards Him (1 Peter 5:8, 2 Chronicles 16:9).

God is always watching for people who are committed to Him, ready to deliver them from trouble (Psalm 91:3). Faith is crucial in Christianity, as every believer has been given a measure of faith to turn hopeless situations around (Romans 12:3, Matthew 17:20). We are saved by faith in Jesus Christ (Romans 10:9) and without faith, it is impossible to please God (Hebrews 11:6). In Hebrews 11, Paul talks about the men and women of faith who accomplished great things through their belief in God. They subdued kingdoms, obtained promises, and were made strong in their weaknesses. Some even suffered torture and death, but remained faithful for the promise of a better resurrection (Hebrews 11:32-38).

As people of faith, we must withstand every affliction of the enemy with our faith (1 Peter 5:8-10, MSG). Proverbs 24:10 warns us not to faint in the day of adversity, meaning to sink, relax, or be disheartened. Our faith is our strength, and we must not droop or despair, but keep a firm grip on our faith, as suffering won't last forever. Speak to circumstances to conform to your words, as we are blessed with all spiritual blessings in Christ (Ephesians 1:3).

Jesus was the first elect of God and we were chosen in Him before the foundation of the world (Ephesians 1:4). He has elevated us to sonship through adoption and regeneration, giving us the power to become sons of God (John 1:12). The eternal covenant is ours for strong consolation and security. Jesus' eye was always fixed on us, and everything in destiny benefits His redeemed. We have the great betrothal of the Prince of Glory and all the consequences of His obedience, atonement, resurrection, ascension, and intercession. He bears our names on His breastplate and pleads our cause at the throne, using His dominion and majesty for our benefit.

Christ's high estate is still at our service, as he now reigns over heaven, earth, and hell with all power and authority given to Him by the Father. In Him, all fullness dwells, and He is the head of the church (Colossians 1:19, Revelation 1:18). He has freed us from the bondage of sin and the curse of the law, taking us as His own portion. Though we are "earthen vessels" (2 Corinthians 4:7), we have the treasure of Christ dwelling in us, giving us strength in the face of troubles and perplexities. Persecutions and catastrophes may come, but we are never abandoned by the Lord who is our support (2 Timothy 2:1, Psalm 18:18, Hebrews 13:5).

Life is like an overpowering military tank, but the Lord Jesus Christ is greater than any attacking tank (1 John 4:4). As a Christian, you have the authority of God and Jesus is your indwelling treasure. Rev Prince Nyarko's song "[I Rule the World!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFXLtROkGRI)" affirms that anything made by God overcomes the world (watch it on YouTube). Critics of the song are either not Christians or not familiar with the Bible's teachings (1 John 5:4-5). If you believe in Jesus as the Son of God, you are born of God and have the power to conquer the world.
