Your right to heaven lies in Christ, not in yourself. All blessings, such as pardon, justification, sanctification, preservation, and perfection, come through Him. In Him, we have obtained all things. The riches of Christ are immeasurable and the inheritance of the elect is limitless. When we are adopted into God's family, we are under a new rule and a new covenant. By clinging to the promises in Scripture, we can find comfort and strength in all circumstances. Store the promises of God in your memory, so you may quote them when needed. All that Jesus has as a perfect man is now yours, including His perfect righteousness. Jesus is our worth.

God changed the names of Abraham, Jacob, and Simon to reveal a new aspect of their character (Genesis 17:5; Genesis 32:28; John 1:42; Matthew 16:18). He also has many names that reveal His nature and character, including Elohim, El Shaddai, Adonai, and Yahweh/Jehovah. Jehovah means "I AM" and is the plain name that teaches unequivocally about the substance of God. Jehovah also has compound names that reveal His characteristics, such as Jehovah-Jireh meaning God is my provider, which was first mentioned in the story of Abraham and Isaac. The Lamb of God, Jesus, willingly gave His life for our sins, fulfilling the symbolism of the ram provided by God in that story.

In Genesis, God promises to bless Abraham and his descendants, and all nations on Earth will be blessed through them. As believers, we have the provider of all things living in us and lack nothing. Jehovah Rophe, the Lord of healing, lives in us, and we are healed by Jesus' stripes (Exodus 15:26; Isaiah 54:4-5; 1 Peter 2:24). To claim our healing, we must become conscious of it and confess it daily. We can choose to live in prosperity and be a blessing to others, and we can also choose to be poor.

We bring healing everywhere, for God is in us. Jehovah-Nissi means "God is our banner" (Exodus 17:15). When Moses's hands were raised, the Israelites won the battle against the Amalekites. We too can win all battles with God on our side (Psalm 118:6). Under His protection, we need not fear any danger or disease (Psalm 91). As believers, we are sanctified by the Holy Spirit and called to be holy (Leviticus 20:8; 2 Timothy 1:9). We are already saved through faith, not by works (Titus 3:5; Galatians 2:16).

As a Christian, you are perfectly saved in God's purpose, as He has ordained you unto salvation, and the price has been paid for you through the sacrifice of Jesus (1 Corinthians 15:22). In Christ, you are made holy by God's workmanship, and this reflects the grace of God. You are secure in this privilege, and nothing can change it. Remember that Jehovah-Shalom, the God of completeness, welfare, peace, health, prosperity, and tranquility, lives in you, and Jehovah-Tsidkenu, the Lord Our Righteousness, reigns in you (Judges 6:24; Jeremiah 23:5-6). Christ Jesus is your righteousness, and you are perfect in Him (Romans 4:3, 13). So, do not be downcast or sad, but be of good cheer, for everything has been done for you by divine grace, and there is nothing wanting in Christ (John 19:30).

"Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory" (1 Peter 1:8) when complete in Christ, through faith in His righteousness (Philippians 3:9). Acknowledge that the law exposes sin (Romans 3:20) but also value the imparted righteousness that comes from accepting Christ as Lord and Savior. Remember that God is with us (Jehovah-Shammah) and will never forsake us (Matthew 28:20; John 14:18; Hebrews 13:5). Psalm 23 contains all the names of God (Jehovah-Rohi, Jehovah-Jireh, Jehovah-Shalom, Jehovah-Rophe, Jehovah-Tsidkenu, Jehovah-Shammah, Jehovah-Nissi, Jehovah-M'Kaddesh), and it is a beautiful expression of the relationship between the shepherd and his sheep, which symbolizes the relationship between God and His people.

Study and meditate upon the Word of God continually (Acts 20:32). To reign in life as a Christian, one needs revelation from the Word of God. The Bible is a treasure and gift from God that can make us what He wants us to be and provide everything we need. Abiding in God's Word is necessary for enjoying His promises on earth. Jesus has everything we need, and we can bring our needs to Him. God cares about us and wants us saved, so [accept Jesus](/salvation) as Lord and Savior to receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
