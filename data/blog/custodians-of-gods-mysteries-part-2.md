According to Hebrews 12:23 in the Amplified Bible, we are registered citizens of Heaven and belong to the assembly of the Firstborn. As Christians, we must ensure that the lyrics we sing align with God's Word. Some of us struggle to discern between law and spirit-inspired words due to our carnality and reliance on our minds. It is crucial to grow spiritually mature in Christ to enjoy all the rights and privileges we have as heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17). As we study the Word, the Spirit will reveal more mysteries to us. Let us eat the Word and be good workmen who understand its meaning (Jeremiah 15:16; 2 Timothy 2:15).

"Brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified" (Acts 20:32). As children of God, His will is revealed in us and to us (Galatians 4:6). We carry His nature and are His expression. In Christ, we have all wisdom and knowledge, and we are called to make known these mysteries to others (Colossians 2:3; 2 Corinthians 2:14). As Christ's ambassadors, we act in His stead on earth. (2 Corinthians 5:20)

In Galatians 3:27, we are told that those who are baptized into Christ are clothed with Christ (1 John 4:13; Colossians 3:3-4). This means that we are completely immersed, baptized, and wrapped in Christ, so much so that Christ is all that can be seen about us. As Colossians 3:3-4 says, our life is hidden with Christ in God, and Christ has become our life. Therefore, we can face life with boldness, courage, and a victor's mentality because we are shielded from the mundane and corrupting influences of the world. We can come boldly to the throne of grace, as Hebrews 4:16 tells us, and claim what belongs to us in Christ. Jesus' blood graciously forgives us, and Christ is made unto us wisdom. We should look to Jesus and not ourselves, as Hebrews 12:2 says.

Depend on the Holy Spirit for new life from heaven (John 3:6, Ephesians 2:1-10). Our standing in the world is like Christ's (1 John 4:17). We are branches of the vine, Jesus (John 15:5), and ambassadors for God (2 Corinthians 5:20). We declare His mysteries and are the salt and light of the world (Matthew 5:13-14). We are chosen to be witnesses of God's will (Acts 22:14-15). Let the peace of God rule your heart (Colossians 3:15) and walk in His prepared way (Isaiah 30:21).

God revealed His will to Paul because he became His son. The Word shows us what God has done, is doing, and will do, so He is not as mysterious as some may think. Through the Spirit, He reveals hidden mysteries to us. The Old Testament people didn't understand God, but in Colossians 1:22-27, we see that Jesus came to reveal the mystery to us: "Christ in you, the hope of glory." We are partakers of His divine nature (Colossians 1:12) and raised up to sit with Christ in heavenly places (Ephesians 2:6). Christ is the head of the church, and we are the body (Ephesians 1:22-23; 5:23). We need to be careful about interpreting Old Testament teachings out of context for New Testament believers. Through the new covenant, God desires to have fellowship with us. Paul was loaded with divine mysteries and made known some in Romans 11.

The Holy Spirit has revealed the mystery of God's will to us. Merely reading the Bible isn't enough; we must seek revelation from God. Paul speaks about the mystery of Christ and the Church, which was hidden but is now made known to His saints. This mystery is that Christ lives in us and is the hope of our glory. Through this, we have full assurance of understanding and acknowledgement of God's mystery. We must pray for boldness to speak the mystery of Christ. (Ephesians 1:9, 3:3-4, 9, 5:32, 6:19; Colossians 1:26-27, 2:2, 4:3)
