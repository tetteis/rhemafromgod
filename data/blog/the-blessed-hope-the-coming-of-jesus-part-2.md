Praise God! Though the saved Spirit battles worldly lusts in the body, Jesus' return will raise us incorruptible. In truth, we never die because we were raised with Christ and are united with Him (Ephesians 2:6; Colossians 2:12-14). As branches of the vine, we bear fruit with the same life flowing through us, making us conquerors (John 15:5; Romans 8:37; 1 John 4:4). Paul refers to the body sleeping, not the spirit (1 Corinthians 15:51).

I love what Spurgeon says concerning this subject:

> Let us not imagine that the spirit sleeps in insensibility. "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise," is the whisper of Christ to every dying saint. They "sleep in Jesus," but their spirits are before the throne of God, praising Him day and night in His temple, singing hallelujahs to Him who washed them from their sins in His blood. The body sleeps in its lonely bed of earth, beneath the coverlet of grass. But what is this sleep? The idea connected with sleep is "rest,"and that is the thought which the Spirit of God would convey to us. Sleep makes each night a Sabbath for the day. Sleep shuts fast the door of the soul, and bids all intruders tarry for a while, that the life within may enter its summer garden of ease. The toil - worn believer quietly sleeps, as does the weary child when it slumbers on its mother's breast.
> Oh! Happy they who die in the Lord; they rest from their labours, and their works do follow them. Their quiet repose shall never be broken until God shall rouse them to give them their full reward. Guarded by angel watchers, curtained by eternal mysteries, they sleep on, the heritors of glory, till the fullness of time shall bring the fullness of redemption. What an awaking shall be theirs! They were laid in their last resting place, weary and worn, but such they shall not rise. They went to their rest with the furrowed brow, and the wasted features, but they wake up in beauty and glory. The shrivelled seed, so destitute of form and comeliness, rises from the dust a beauteous flower. The winter of the grave gives way to the spring of redemption and the summer of glory. Through death the divine power disrobes us of this work-day garment, to clothe us with the wedding garment of incorruption. Blessed are those who "sleep in Jesus.""

When Lazarus died, Jesus referred to him as sleeping and said he would awake him (John 11:11). Resurrecting someone from the dead is not difficult for God. God demonstrated this to Ezekiel with the dry bones (Ezekiel 37:1-10). On the last day, the dead will be raised and we will all be changed, imperishable and immortal. As children of God, we were empowered by God's decision to give birth to us, not by mortal means but by His living Word (John 1:12-13).

The prophet said, "The old life is like grass and its beauty is short-lived as wildflowers. Grass dries up, flowers droop, but God's Word endures forever," (1 Peter 1:23-25). When we become born again, our spirit is born again because it is most important to God. The body may die, but the spirit lives on. Believers wait for the resurrection of their body into eternal life with the Lord, while unbelievers wait for the resurrection of their body into eternal condemnation. The believer is only resting, waiting for the resurrection of their body into eternal life. When a believer dies, they have gone back home to be with the Lord. As children of God, we do not belong to this world (John 15:19; 17:14). We will be transformed into the likeness of Jesus when he appears (Philippians 3:20-21; 1 John 3:1-2).

The psalmist's powerful statements remind us that the Lord is our refuge and strength, in whom we can trust (Psalm 9:9; 18:2; 27:4-5; 30:5; 73:26). We should desire to dwell in the house of the Lord and seek Him always (Psalm 37:39; 46:1-2; 48:14; 138:7; Isaiah 40:29-31; 49:14-16; 51:3; 66:12-14; Nahum 1:7). God's love for us endures forever, and He promises to wipe away all tears and make all things new (Revelation 21:1-5). Therefore, let us be strong and steadfast, abounding in the Lord's work, for nothing we do for Him is ever wasted (1 Corinthians 15:58). We have a solid promise from Jesus that those who come to Him will never be cast out, but will have everlasting life (John 6:37-40).

Let us not be troubled or afraid, for nothing can separate us from God's love (Romans 8:31-29). This does not mean that we should die prematurely or take our own lives as God did not give us that authority. You can decide to live a long life and refuse to die like a "chicken." It's not true that God kills people, and we should be careful about the things we accept. We can live long, and even exceed the "three score and ten" years stated in Psalm 90:10. Moses' statement about a reduced lifespan was not for everyone, and he himself lived to be 120 years old (Deuteronomy 34:7). Don't accept a premature death as a norm, but instead have faith in God for a long life.

As a born again child of God, the life of God flows through every fiber of your being. Through faith, even the dead can be brought back to life, as demonstrated in Hebrews 11:35. Your belief and meditation on the Word of God are crucial for growing your faith and aligning your thoughts and words with scripture (Mark 9:23; John 14:12). Be mindful of the words you speak and the thoughts you entertain, as they shape your reality (Matthew 12:37; Proverbs 23:7). Instead, fix your attention on God and allow Him to transform you from the inside out.

God brings out the best in you and develops maturity in you, unlike the culture around you that drags you down to immaturity (Ephesians 4:13). The Word of God must dominate our lives, for it has the power to transform us into what it talks about. Be careful of who you listen to because you become your confession (Proverbs 18:21). Don't believe people who say that aging is full of troubles and sicknesses. Fill your heart and mind with the Scriptures, for the Word of God is Spirit and life to those who receive it in faith (Hebrews 4:12). We're called to maturity, not to fall sick or die young. God desires us to prosper and be in good health (3 John 1:2). Stockpile treasures in heaven, for our works of labor will follow us and we'll receive our reward (Matthew 6:20, Luke 12:33). Our resources should go towards the gospel, reaching the unreached, and helping people understand God better (Matthew 28:19-20).

Praise God for our blessed hope. Society teaches fear, but God's Word brings knowledge of the true and real you. Meditate on this and be courageous. Whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. Don't wait to accept Christ into your life. He is the solution to your problems. Encourage one another and may the God of hope fill you with joy and peace through the Holy Ghost (Romans 15:13). God bless you!
