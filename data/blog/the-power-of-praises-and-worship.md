"Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name" (Psalm 100:4). We must approach God with a joyful heart and thanksgiving. Some Christians think that crying will make God do something for them, but God desires a happy spirit. We should not sing songs that keep us sorrowful, but sing songs that praise God. We should make our requests known to God with thanksgiving, not with crying. Praying with thanksgiving shows God that we are operating in faith and He responds to it. We have been given all things through the knowledge of God, so we should not complain when asking God for something. It's like having a fridge filled with everything you need and being told to take what you want from it.

Believers often fail to recognize the blessings God has made available to them. Instead of complaining, we should praise God and acknowledge what He has provided. The story of King Jehoshaphat in 2 Chronicles 20 is an excellent example of this. When facing a great multitude in battle, Jehoshaphat sought the Lord, and the Spirit of the Lord spoke through Jahaziel to assure him that the battle was God's. Jehoshaphat and all Judah worshipped the Lord and praised Him with a loud voice, and God granted them victory without them having to fight.

The Lord gave a prophecy to Judah, Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat, and the next day they went out as promised. Jehoshaphat encouraged the people to believe in the Lord and his prophets, and appointed singers to praise the Lord before the army. When they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushments against their enemies and they were defeated. Jehoshaphat and his people worshiped the Lord and praised Him. When facing a problem, we should seek the Lord's word for an answer, as there is a solution in the Bible. We should respond with praise and worship, just like Jehoshaphat and his people did. By glorifying God, we can receive the answer through thanksgiving.

Jehoshaphat encouraged his people to believe in God and His promises before heading to battle. He appointed singers to lead the army, and they sang praises to God. Even though God did not tell them to sing, it was as they praised Him that He set ambushments against their enemies. They found great wealth after their enemies were defeated (2 Chronicles 20:20-25). Thankfulness is the key to entering the sacredness of God's glory. Access to His blessings is automatic when you come with thanksgiving. The peak of faith operation is thanksgiving.

Paul and Silas were arrested unjustly for casting out a spirit of divination from a girl who brought profit to her masters. The masters accused them of causing trouble and teaching unlawful customs. The magistrates ordered them to be beaten and thrown into prison, where they were kept in uncomfortable and dismal conditions. Despite their suffering, Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises to God at midnight. God responded by causing a great earthquake that opened the doors of the prison and loosed their bonds (Acts 16:16-26). Their praise demonstrated the power of faith and pleased God

In another story, when Jesus arrived at Lazarus' tomb, Martha remarked that he had been dead for four days and was now decomposing. Jesus demonstrated His faith in God by thanking His Father before calling Lazarus back to life (John 11:39-44). In Luke 17, when ten lepers cried out for mercy, Jesus told them to go show themselves to the priest, and as they went, they were cleansed. One of them returned to give thanks and was declared completely whole by Jesus (Luke 17:19). Thanking God is an expression of faith that brings us into His presence and power, as God inhabits the praises of His people (Psalms 22:3). Christ's presence is manifested in gatherings where He is the focus, and the highest form of faith is thanksgiving. Gifts of the Spirit often operate in church services following a time of praise and worship.

In the school of prayer, thanksgiving is the final signature and the will of God for us (I Thessalonians 5:23). It's an expression of confidence in God and brings His presence and power. Genuine praise must come from the heart and not just be lip service like the Pharisees (Matthew 15:8).

Below are some Biblical Expressions of Praise:

1. Declaring of thanks (Hebrews 13:15)
2. Clapping hands and shouting (Psalm 47:1)
3. Musical instruments and dancing (Psalm. 150:4)
4. Singing praise songs (Psalm 9:11)
5. Psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs (Ephesians 5:19-20)
6. Making a joyful noise (Psalm 98:4)
7. By lifting our hands (Psalm 134:2)
8. By being still (Psalm 4:3-5, 46:10)
9. By being loud (Psalm 33:3, 95:1-6)

Express confidence in God and guarantee your reward. To fulfill God's promises in your life, adopt a lifestyle of thanksgiving.
