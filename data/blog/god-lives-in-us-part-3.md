As we receive grace from Jesus and recognize it as coming from Him, we can commune with Him and enjoy the felicity of His presence. Let us use our riches and boldly take from Him all that we need. Through the Holy Spirit, Christ dwells in us and we are His Body, with Him as the Head (Colossians 1:18; Ephesians 5:30). The victory of the Lord Jesus is our victory, but people struggle with evil spirits because of wrong thinking (Proverbs 23:7). Faith in God's Word, acted upon, brings results every time. We are one with God and joint-heirs with Christ, bought with His blood (Romans 8:15-17; ). Renewing our minds with the Word is crucial, as our beliefs and words shape our faith and destiny (Matthew 12:37; Romans 10:9-10; Proverbs 15:4). Jesus bought us as a gift for God, redeeming us through His blood (1 Corinthians 6:20).

The Greek word "agorazo" means Christ purchased us with His blood as a gift to God. He died for our sins, rose from the dead, and ascended to sit at the right hand of God. We are also seated at the right hand of God, far above all power and authority. In Christ, we are complete and filled with divine wisdom and knowledge. We are joint-heirs with Him and have access to all His riches. Let us not make a show of Christ, but use what He has made available to us.

The word "redeemed" as seen in Revelation 5:9 is the Greek word "agorazo" means Christ purchased us with His blood as a gift to God. He died for our sins, rose from the dead, and ascended to sit at the right hand of God (Romans 8:34; Ephesians 1:20; Colossians 3:1; Hebrews 1:3; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2; 1 Peter 3:22). We are also seated at the right hand of God, far above all power and authority (Ephesians 2:6). In Christ, we are complete and filled with divine wisdom and knowledge (Colossians 2:9). We are joint-heirs with Him and have access to all His riches (Romans 8:17). Let us not make a show of Christ, but use what He has made available to us.

Jesus is one with the Father, as the Jews recognized and sought to stone Him for blasphemy (John 10:30). However, Jesus did not cling to His status as equal with God and instead humbled Himself to become human, setting aside His privileges as deity (Philippians 2:6-7). Buddha, known as the enlightened one, acknowledged his search for truth even on his deathbed, in contrast to Jesus who proclaimed Himself as the light of the world and the way, the truth, and the life (John 8:12, John 14:6). As believers, we too are called to be the light of the world, citizens of heaven not of this world (Matthew 5:14, John 15:19, Philippians 3:20). We have the authority and rights in Christ to impress and enforce upon the world its systems and way of doing things (Job 22:29), confessing our strength in God and shining brightly even in the darkness (Joel 3:10, Nehemiah 8:10, 2 Corinthians 4:6). The Almighty God now lives in us, and we have come unto mount Sion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem (Hebrews 12:18-24).

In Hebrews 12:18-24, Paul describes how we have come to Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to God, the Judge of all. We are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, and a holy nation (1 Peter 2:9). In the Old Testament, the priests had to be anointed and clean to perform their duties for God, but today, God lives in us, and we are holy (Exodus 19:5, 6). We are the container of God and the pledge of His presence. The presence of God in us makes us strong and confident, and we should have no fear (1 John 4:4). We offer sacrifices to God as priests, with praises from our lips (Hebrews 13:15). Our origin is in God, and the devil and his cohorts have no power over us. (1 John 5:5).

Before Jesus, we were in darkness, and the devil had authority over us because of Adam's actions. There was a dispute between Michael and the devil over the body of Moses, but Michael didn't condemn the devil and said, "The Lord rebuke you!" (Jude 1:9). But when Jesus came, He took back the authority that Satan stole from Adam and gave it to us (Matthew 28:18; Luke 10:19). We have the right to cast out demons from every aspect of our lives.

We have been delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of His dear Son (Colossians 1:13). We don't need deliverance from the devil anymore. Our association with Christ has given us every blessing, just like the promise made to Abraham and his seed (Genesis 13:15; 17:8).

In Christ, there is no distinction between male or female. We are all one in Christ Jesus (Galatians 3:28). Jesus gave us all the rights and privileges which went with Himself when He gave Himself for us. We are joint-heirs, and all the glorious consequences of His obedience are ours (Hebrews 6:20, 9:24).
