Jesus taught Nicodemus about being born again, but he didn't understand. Despite knowing the Old Testament well, Nicodemus lacked revelation from it. Knowing the Bible is important, but understanding the God it reveals and the salvation He offers is even more important. God wants us to know Him personally and experience His character. Scripture says, "Let him who glories glory in this: that he understands and knows Me personally and practically" (Jeremiah 9:24, Amp). The wisdom of God is priceless and brings success in all things. Paul considered everything else as loss compared to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus his Lord (Philippians 3:8).

"I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ—the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith. I want to know Christ—yes, to know the power of his resurrection and participation in his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so, somehow, attaining to the resurrection from the dead." (Philippians 3:8-11, NIV)

Paul's pursuit of God is evident in his actions. Those who know their God shall be strong and do exploits. God satisfies those who hunger and thirst for Him. (Daniel 11:32; Nehemiah 9:15)

As Paul says, we should desire spiritual gifts and make every thought obedient to Christ. (1 Corinthians 14:1; 2 Corinthians 10:5). Paul also speaks about the mysteries of God, the wisdom of God that was hidden from the princes of this world but revealed to us by the Spirit. (1 Corinthians 2:1-10).

1 Corinthians 2:1-16 reveals that only the Spirit of God can reveal the things of God. Paul taught the Word not with human wisdom, but with the demonstration of the Spirit and power, and miracles followed (Acts 19:11-12). Those who reject the works of the Spirit are spiritually ignorant (Mark 16:17-18). Paul taught about both the 9 fruits and 9 gifts of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22). Criticizing the works of the Spirit is a serious problem. Jesus fulfilled the scripture from Isaiah and the Word of God endures forever (Luke 4:18-21).

Isaiah may have passed away in Jesus' day, but the Word of the Lord remains on earth. Whoever steps into the Word and declares "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me" will have the Spirit rest upon them. Standing on the Word, like the disciples, yields the same results. Act on Acts 22:14 and declare that the God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will. You have been chosen to know the revelation of that Just One and to hear His voice. To recognize His voice, develop an appetite for the Word and train your spirit to respond to God's promptings (John 10:14, 27). Pray mostly in other tongues to become more sensitive to His voice. Understand that God deals with His children differently from the rest of the world. Don't talk like a victim; you have insight into the secrets of God and know that all things work together for your good (Mark 4:11; Luke 8:10; Romans 8:28).
