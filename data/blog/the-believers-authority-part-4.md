Some think salvation means continuing to be ruled by sin, sickness, poverty, fear, and bondage until barely making it to Heaven. But we can reign in life by Christ Jesus, receiving abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness. We have authority to rule and reign in our lives here on earth. Jesus went to hell to take back the authority the devil stole from Adam. We have the authority to cast out devils, speak with new tongues, take up serpents, drink poison without harm, lay hands on the sick and recover. Lack of knowledge keeps people from ruling and reigning in life.

God's people are destroyed for lack of knowledge, not sinners (Hosea 4:6). Christians often fail to realize their authority in Christ, leading to Satan's rule in their lives. Romans 5:17 states that we shall reign in life through Jesus Christ. We must receive the abundance of grace and gift of righteousness to reign. In Christ, there is no distinction between male and female (Galatians 3:28), and we are made kings and priests unto God (Revelation 1:6). However, many Christians only function in their priestly ministry and forget to exercise their kingly authority.

Do Christians today practice going to a high priest to ask for forgiveness like in the Old Testament? No, we go straight to God and ask for forgiveness ourselves. As children of God, we are called to reign in life and exercise authority. We need to know and live accordingly, speaking with the authority of a king. Jesus demonstrated this authority when he commanded the wind and waves to be still during a storm. We should not let life's challenges take over us, but instead take charge and dominate. God expects us to speak and make declarations to circumstances, rather than relying solely on others to solve our problems.

Many confide in non-believers, but we must keep a cool head and stay alert as the devil is poised to attack (1 Peter 5:7-11). As kings, we make decrees and proclamations that establish what we say (Job 22:28). We should exercise our authority in Christ, rather than begging for everything. Exercise your God-given authority over sickness, disease, and negativity, and God will be happy to see you take charge. We've received not only grace but also the gift of righteousness (James 1:12).

Righteousness is a gift from God, and we have it by faith in Jesus Christ. We cannot earn or grow in righteousness. We are made right with God through faith in Jesus and have permanent right-standing with Him (2 Corinthians 5:21). Our sins are washed away by the blood of Jesus, and we are new creatures in Christ. If we sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, who pleads our case (1 John 2:1). We can turn to God and ask for forgiveness if we sin, knowing that we have right-standing with Him through Christ.

Jesus took my place and shed His blood for me, making me righteous in God's eyes. Confessing my sins allows God to forgive and cleanse me (John 1:9), giving me the ability to rule and reign instead of being ruled by Satan. [Accepting Jesus as my Savior](/salvation) is the greatest thing that can happen to me, and His manifestation in my life brings righteousness and healing. Christ should be manifested in my spirit, soul, and body, and loving Him and keeping His Word is the key to experiencing His manifestation in my life.

Jesus can show Himself to you not only by directing you through your spirit but also by making you physically healthy and strong. If you allow Christ in you, He can heal your legs or give you a new heart. Follow Him and immerse yourself in His Word for a triumphant life. As believers, we should study the Word of God day and night (2 Timothy 2:15; Psalm 1:1-3) because it brings true satisfaction. To grow spiritually, we must meditate on God's Word (1 Peter 2:2). Jeremiah's burning passion for God's Word resulted from eating and meditating on it. When facing challenges, God's Word will well up in you and make giving up impossible.

Stay strong in the face of challenges, as nothing can defeat us (Romans 8:37). Guard your spirit against false teachings (Galatians 5:1) and share the Gospel of God's mercy and forgiveness (2 Peter 3:9). May your life reflect God's grace and open doors that no one can shut, as you remain fruitful and anointed in all your endeavors, in Jesus' Name. Amen!
