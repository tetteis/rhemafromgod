Questions like "Can a Christian lose his salvation?" or "Once saved, always saved?" are common among people, especially new converts. It is essential to understand that a Christian is a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17), a different being with a [new life](zoe-the-god-kind-of-life-part-1), regardless of whether they were raised in a Christian home or have said a prayer. While these things can be part of the Christian experience, they are not what makes a person a Christian.

A Christian is someone who has trusted in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior and has received the Holy Spirit (John 3:16; Acts 16:31; Ephesians 2:8-9). They are not an improved version of their old self; they are a new being with a new life. Therefore, a Christian cannot lose their salvation because eternal life is a promise from God. "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:16).

Eternal life is the promise of spending forever in heaven with God. God promises, "Believe and you will have eternal life." The Christian's life comes from Jesus, and they cannot do anything without Him. "I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing" (John 15:5). The believer has the life of God, and their former life, which originated from their earthly parents, died in Christ the moment they confessed His Lordship over their life. God's Word promises that when someone comes to know Christ as their Savior, they are brought into a relationship with God that guarantees their eternal security (Ephesians 1:13-14).

The Christian is God's possession (1 Corinthians 6:20). They are declared righteous, and God sees them as His Glory. He justifies them, not because they are innocent, but on the basis of their trust in Jesus, who took away their sins. Jesus exchanged His place for the sinner's; He took their dirt and gave them His estate (2 Corinthians 5:21).

We were purchased at the cost of Christ's death (1 Peter 1:18-19), and God does not buy and lose! For a Christian to lose their salvation, everything that Jesus came to do has to be reversed, and God has to go back on His Word, which is impossible. Salvation is God's gift from start to finish, and we do not play the major role. If we did, we would go around bragging that we have done the whole thing. But, no, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving (Ephesians 2).

A Christian cannot lose their salvation because they are born again and possess eternal life. They have a new life that comes from Jesus, and they are God's possession. The believer's faith conquers the world's ways, and they are powerful. To sum it up, once saved, always saved!
