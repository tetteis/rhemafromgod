#### PERSECUTED, BUT NOT FORSAKEN

The processes one has to go through when infected with the virus (or deemed as having come into contact with an infected person), is just like the situation of someone who has been rejected or disowned by relations.

Firstly, infected persons are usually isolated for proper medical attention and care.

Secondly, persons who have had contact with the infected are likewise isolated for 14 days after which the symptoms shown will determine whether or not they are infected.

Thirdly, in countries where there are partial or total lockdown measures, people's rights of movement are hindered.

Fourthly, all forms of mass gathering including that of religious bodies have been banned temporarily.

The Oxford dictionary explains persecution as a program or campaign to subjugate or eliminate a specific group of people, often based on race, religion, sexuality, or social beliefs. So you see, by definition, the above four situations mean people are facing some amount of persecution, only that this time around, it is not based on race nor religion, but COVID-19 status.

But the good news still stands: you are only being persecuted - in this case, isolated/quarantined - for a while, not forsaken as it may seem. As and when your health gets recovered, you are brought back to your family, friends and or loved ones - life will still go on. Be encouraged.

#### STRUCK DOWN BUT NOT DESTROYED

> We know how to bring the economy back to life. What we do not know is how to bring people back to life.

> &mdash; His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo (President of Ghana).

The economy of Ghana and that of other countries indeed have been struck down. Companies and businesses have been struck down. Education has been struck down. Major means of transportation have been struck down. The stock markets have been struck down. Many other things have been equally struck down.

The other truth which is less spoken of is that economies are still running anyways; some companies, businesses and education systems have moved online and running anyways. We are struck down, yes, but be encouraged by God's Word that it does not mean we are destroyed. God is bringing a lifting.

We may have come to the end of our human efforts/strengths, but this is where God steps in, takes the wheel and drives us to divine safety. Friends, family and loved ones, we need you in these trying times to be strong and courageous. Keep to the precautionary measures given by the health workers: wash hands frequently with soap under running water, use hand sanitisers (with an alcohol base of at least 60 per cent), use gloves and nose masks when and where necessary, and if you do not have anywhere/anything so urgent to attend to, please stay home. And after all is said and done, PRAY TO GOD TO RESCUE US, HE IS OUR ONE AND ONLY SURE PRESENT HELP IN TIMES OF TROUBLE. Psalm 46:1

As the common phrase goes,

> if there is a man to pray, there is a God to answer.

I have made provision for some prayer topics below based on the Word of God. Spend some quality time praying along with these topics for yourself, your family, your friends, your loved ones, your country, and the world at large.

- Prayer 2 - Gracious Father, hide us in your secret place, cover us and our families under your shadow in Jesus' name. (Psalm 91:1)
