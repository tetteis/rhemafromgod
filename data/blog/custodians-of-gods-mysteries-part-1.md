People have written books and articles about the relationship between God and man. Some are helpful, while others contradict the truth found in Christ. Only the Spirit of God can reveal the mysteries of God to believers, as the carnal mind is hostile to God (Romans 8:7-8). Trying to understand God with the mind leads to misinterpretation of scripture. The letter of the law kills, but the Spirit gives life (2 Corinthians 3:6). Some teachings can lead to death if they do not come from the Spirit. We should not present God as a wicked God, as this hinders fellowship with Him. Humble-sounding teachings can be ignorant.

In Ephesians 3:17-19, Paul prays for the saints at Ephesus that Christ would dwell in their hearts, that they would be rooted in love, and that they would comprehend the love of Christ, which surpasses mere knowledge. This would enable them to be filled with the fullness of God and become a body wholly filled and flooded with God Himself.

Understanding the love of God is essential to experiencing His presence and power in our lives. We must remember that we are spirit beings and that our bodies are merely vessels (1 Thessalonians 5:23). When we are born again, our spirit is reborn as righteous, even though we may struggle with sin in the flesh (Romans 8:10, Amp). God deals with us Spirit to spirit, and nothing can separate us from His love (1 Corinthians 2:14; Romans 8:38-39, MSG).

God is holy and does not associate with sin. Confessing Jesus as Lord and Savior imparts His holy nature to your spirit, allowing Him to commune with the real you (Isaiah 1:18). Christians who prosper with the Word have experienced the life and peace it brings (1 John 1:1). The Gospel of John shows that knowing God involves a personal relationship with Jesus, who reveals the Father's purpose and nature. You cannot know God until you have communion, fellowship with Him. The result of knowledge is having a personal relationship with God through His Son (John 17:3; John 14:7, NLT).

In Christ, God's revelation is the source of knowledge. The spiritual person is taught by the Spirit of God and responds to truth as revealed in Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 2:12-16). Christian knowledge is based on experience in Christ, not observation or speculation. Relationship and encounter are essential elements. Knowledge contrasts natural wisdom.

We stand in relationship with God through Christ, knowing His mysteries. Study Scripture to know what it says. Like the Bereans, search the Scriptures daily (Acts 17:11). Grow in understanding; don't remain a spiritual babe. As Paul said to the Corinthians, we must move from milk to solid food (Hebrews 5:12-13; 1 Corinthians 3:1-2).

Jesus brings a new covenant, and as its mediator, His death became a proclamation of grace. At Mt. Sinai, God met with Moses and instructed him to prepare the Israelites to meet Him. They heard His powerful voice and were terrified (Exodus 19:12-22; 20:18-21; Deuteronomy 4:11, 12; 5:22-27; Deuteronomy 9:19). But as New Testament believers, we have come to Mount Zion, the Heavenly Jerusalem, where God dwells with multitudes of angels in festal gathering (Hebrews 12:18-23).
