The world's economy is often in shambles, with people complaining everywhere. However, God's eyes are on the generous, and they have set their hearts to prosper His work. God's financial system is independent of the world's economy, and the children of God should not be limited by it. God can pour out blessings on you so that you can be self-sufficient and possess enough to help carry out your godly responsibilities. You will not require aid or support from the government or any organization, but instead, you will donate and give to people, even if the world's economy is in a mess.

Jeremiah 17:7-8 reminds us that the man who believes in, trusts in, and relies on the Lord will be blessed. He will be like a tree planted by the waters that spreads out its roots by the river and will not be anxious or full of care in the year of drought, nor will he cease yielding fruit. The Word says we won't be anxious and full of care like the rest of the world. We don't just survive in the world; we thrive!

However, there are believers who are always complaining. They have decided to remain where they are, not realizing that the Lord makes us rich to carry out His plans and purposes in the earth. In 2 Corinthians 9, Paul talks about the benevolent person who scatters abroad, gives to the poor, and whose deeds of justice, goodness, kindness, and benevolence endure forever. God provides seed for the sower and bread for eating, and He will also provide and multiply your resources for sowing and increase the fruits of your righteousness. Thus you will be enriched in all things and in every way so that you can be generous. Your generosity will bring forth thanksgiving to God.

The benevolent person's work will go on and endure forever (Psalm 112:9). He has an anointing upon him that causes everything he does to prosper, and he wins where others are failing. He may have little or no knowledge about his work, but the Lord gives him a special grace to function (Exodus 31:1-11). Nothing can stop him from being fruitful in the office God has called him to. God Himself provides seed for the sower and bread for the eater, so what does he have to worry about? Nothing at all! Scripture says he will be enriched in all things and every way. This is so that he can continue his generosity, which brings forth thanksgiving to God (2 Corinthians 9:8-12).

Believers need to understand the mysteries in Christ. There's so much in Christ, and until you give yourself to the ministry of the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't know much. There's a big difference between being passionate about making wealth for the Kingdom of God and loving wealth itself. Never put your trust in wealth - learn to share what you have: "Trust in your money and down you go! But the godly flourish like leaves in spring" (Proverbs 11:28).
