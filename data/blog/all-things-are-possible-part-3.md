Once, Jesus saw a fig tree with leaves from a distance while He was hungry. He went to it, hoping to find figs, but found only leaves as it wasn't the season for figs. Jesus cursed the tree, and the next day it was found withered. When Peter pointed it out, Jesus told them to have the faith of God (Mark 11:12-14, 20-22). The human-kind of faith is not real faith, as it is based on sensory perception (Hebrews 11:1).

After His resurrection, Jesus appeared to His disciples, but Thomas wasn't present. When they told him, he refused to believe unless he saw Jesus' wounds himself. A week later, Jesus appeared to them all, including Thomas. Jesus told Thomas to believe, even though he hadn't seen Him before. Jesus then blessed those who believed without seeing (John 20:19-29). Believe what God says, not what you see.

In Mark 4:37-40, a strong wind caused waves to spill over into a boat with Jesus and His disciples. Jesus commanded the wind and waves to be still and chided the disciples for their lack of faith.

As Christians, we must put God's Word to work to strengthen our faith. Refuse to give in to negativity and instead speak kind words that heal and help. Your tongue has the power to preserve or destroy life, so be careful with your words (Proverbs 18:21). Choose to listen more and speak less (James 1:19; James 3:2), and exercise your faith regularly to experience the life God desires for you.

Mistakes are common to all, but one who never slips in speech is mature and can control their whole body (James 3:2-5). Our words have great power and can either build up or destroy (James 3:5). To love life and see good days, we must refrain from speaking evil and guile (1 Peter 3:10). Rather than trying to change others, we should value ourselves and allow positive influences to shape us (Proverbs 23:7). We become what we allow into ourselves, so we must choose our words and influences carefully.

A woman complained about her daughter to a pastor, who counseled her to see her daughter in a positive light and gave her proclamations to make about her daughter. The daughter later accepted Jesus as her Savior.

To win people to Christ, avoid a "holier than thou attitude" and understand their situation. Look at people through the lens of Christ's finished work and love them as they are. Avoid judging others and concentrate on seeing the best in them. Mind your own business and seek the well-being of others. Coping with your spouse's behavior and making positive confessions about them is important. Be careful not to hinder others from serving God and avoid judging others.

Below are some statements from one of the Apostles of Faith, Smith Wigglesworth, that inspire me so much. I believe they will be a blessing to you.

1. ONLY BELIEVE" - "FAITH IS AN ACT!"
2. "I'M NOT MOVED BY WHAT I SEE, I'M ONLY MOVED BY WHAT I BELIEVE"
3. "GOD GIVES THE MORE TO US, THE MORE WE BELIEVE IN HIM"
4. "Don't pray for the sick, HEAL THE SICK!
5. "If the Holy Spirit does not move me, I move the Holy Spirit." "I don't wait until I feel anointed" - "I act on faith" - "If I do this then God will move towards me." Stir up the gift that is within YOU.
6. "FAITH ACTED ON LEADS TO MORE FAITH." "HAVE THE FAITH OF GOD" MARK 11:22.
7. "HAVE THE FAITH OF CHRIST" (Imparted faith) (GALATIANS 2:20).
8. "Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God."
9. "GOD SAID IT, I BELIEVE IT - THAT SETTLES IT!"

In conclusion, meditate on God's Word and fill your being with it. All things are possible for you. The Word of God is timeless, so study it repeatedly. Remember to appreciate your blessings and take the words in this article with you. Make it a part of your library, share it with others, and study it until you're certain of what God says about you (Matthew 24:35; Mark 13:31; Luke 21:33).

I pray that you'll grow closer to the Lord every day and that others will see Him in you. However, these articles won't benefit you unless you're born again. To experience a life-changing transformation, [accept Jesus today](/salvation).
