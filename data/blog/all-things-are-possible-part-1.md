Despite the fast pace of events, both good and bad, including the rise of crime and suicide, and the ongoing impact of Covid, our Lord has already overcome the world (John 16:33). We must remain calm and not be troubled, as Jesus instructed us (Matthew 24:6), even though many people in these uncertain times may be fearful and despairing. It's tragic that some individuals may feel that suicide or murder is the only way out, but this is not an option for those who belong to God, as our lives are not our own to take (Luke 21:26). Instead, we should trust in God, believe that all things are possible, and seek knowledge to be delivered from any suffering (Proverbs 11:9). As Christians, we are the light of the world, and even in dark times, our light will shine brighter (Matthew 5:14).

The Apostle Paul urges us to rely on God and His grace, which can build us up and grant us an inheritance (Acts 20:32). In a world filled with anxiety and disease, we must renew our minds with the Word of God (Romans 12:2) and take every thought captive to Christ (2 Corinthians 10:5). As heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ (Romans 8:17), we should not live like slaves, but rather seek knowledge of our identity in Christ and understand who He is (Jeremiah 9:23-24). Lack of knowledge can lead to destruction (Hosea 4:6), but by studying and meditating on the Word, we can live a life that glorifies Him.

Moses sent out leaders to explore the land of Canaan from the wilderness of Paran for forty days. When they returned, the spies reported that the land was abundant but the people were strong, and some of the leaders were intimidated by the inhabitants. Caleb encouraged the people to go and possess the land, but the others spread a bad report about the land and its inhabitants. Moses had instructed them to assess the land, people, towns, soil, and vegetation and bring back samples of the produce. (Numbers 13)

The Israelites reported what they saw, but it displeased God. They cried and wanted to return to Egypt, and Moses and Aaron bowed down. Caleb and Joshua said the land was good and not to fear the people, but the community threatened to stone them. God appeared over the Tent and decided that none over twenty years old would enter the Promised Land, except Joshua and Caleb. The rest died of disease.

The Lord told Moses and Aaron that only Caleb and Joshua would enter the Promised Land. Caleb had a different spirit and followed the Lord fully, so God promised to bring him and his descendants into the land. (Numbers 14). Complaining is not pleasing to God, and in times of adversity, we must not lose faith. As Christians, we all have faith, but we must cultivate and grow it. With even a small amount of faith, nothing is impossible. (Matthew 17:20; Luke 17:6).

Though every Christian receives faith when born again, it is not enough to overcome fear and doubt. Fear and faith are opposite; fear weakens faith, hindering its effectiveness. Doubting God's Word also weakens faith. Little faith may start, but it cannot finish the task and is easily overcome by fear, uncertainty, and doubt. For instance, when Peter doubted, he began to sink despite initially responding to Jesus' call with his little faith (Matthew 14:24-31).

To grow in faith and handle life's challenges, feed on the Word of God as newborn babies desire milk (1 Peter 2:2). Meditate on the Word day and night, delighting in the law of the Lord, and prosper like a tree planted by the rivers of water (Psalm 1:1-3). If the Word of God is not in you, your thoughts and actions may be misguided. Thrill to God's Word and respond with knowledge to develop great faith that does not easily give up (MSG).

To increase faith, listen or watch gospel materials as "faith comes by hearing" (Romans 10:17). Gain more information about problems from God's Word to reduce doubt. Act on the Word received and become a doer, not just a hearer, to grow faith. As James 1:22-25 states, those who do the work of the Word shall be blessed. Remember, God's Word is powerful and can energize and program for greatness.

If someone is sick, but believes they were healed by Jesus' stripes (1 Peter 2:24), they shouldn't speak sickness over themselves. The Word of God is a mirror (2 Corinthians 3:18), and believers should let it reveal the truth about them. Speak faith instead of what the world says. As James 1:25 says, those who catch a glimpse of the revealed Word and stick with it are people of action and will be blessed. Putting faith to work strengthens it, but lack of exercise leads to weak faith and doubt. This causes faith to stagger and fear to set in.
