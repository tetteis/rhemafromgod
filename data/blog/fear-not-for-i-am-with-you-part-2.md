In the Old Testament, only priests had the Spirit constantly upon them, but as new creations in Christ, we have the Holy Ghost with us 24/7. With this power, we can do great things and overcome any obstacle, even walking on water or facing wild animals (John 14:12; Acts 28:1-6). Believers can perish due to lack of knowledge, but with faith and the power of our words, we can claim healing and victory over any sickness. Daniel's faith and trust in God led to his promotion, despite attempts to discredit him. When faced with challenges, we must trust in God and His power to see us through.

King Darius ordered for Daniel to be thrown into a den of lions, but he believed in the God of Daniel and was confident that God would deliver him. Daniel was not hurt by the lions because he believed in God. King Darius recognized the anointing on Daniel's life and wrote to all people, nations, and languages, commanding that they fear the living God of Daniel (Daniel 6:24-28). It's essential to know God and be bold in him because only God can bring out the real person in you. Don't put your trust and hope in men, for they may be weak, but with God, all things are possible.

Caleb and Joshua saw the land of Canaan differently from the other spies, who gave an evil report to the congregation. While the others saw giants and wanted to return to Egypt, Caleb and Joshua believed that the Lord would give them the land. They told the congregation to have faith and not rebel against the Lord. The other spies' report was evil, but Caleb and Joshua saw things from a faith-point of view (Numbers 14:6-9). Pharaoh couldn't kill Moses, and David defeated Goliath because they had faith in the Lord. It's important to have faith in the Word of God and not define problems based on what we see.

In 1 Samuel 17, David was informed that the man who killed Goliath would receive the king's daughter in marriage and his father's house would be free from tax. David was conscious of the relationship with God and knew that an uncircumcised Philistine could not overcome God's people because he was not a part of the covenant. David's faith was bold and he knew what God could do. When David offered to fight Goliath, Saul questioned his ability, but David's faith in God was unwavering. He refused Saul's armor and armed only with his sling and stones, he faced Goliath. David's faith was in God and not in armor.

Goliath disdained David for being a youth with fair countenance, and threatened to give his flesh to the fowls of the air and beasts of the field. But David stood in the Name of the Lord and trusted in His strength. He proclaimed that the Lord would deliver Goliath into his hand, and with a stone and sling, David slew Goliath and cut off his head. David's faith was not in physical strength but in the power of God. By studying the Word, we can grow in knowledge and faith. The men of old were made righteous by their faith, not their works. Read Hebrews 11 to learn how they put their faith to work.

The Bible records numerous accounts of people who demonstrated great faith, such as Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, and Samuel. Through faith, they conquered kingdoms, worked righteousness, and obtained promises. Even when faced with trials and torture, they remained faithful in their belief in God. As Christians, we also have the Word of God, the Holy Spirit, and angels as our guides and protectors. We are to be strong and courageous, knowing that God is with us and will never forsake us.

We must put on the whole armor of God and stand firm in our faith, for this is how we can defeat the enemy. We should not be afraid of men or troubled by their terror, but we should always be ready to give an answer for our hope with meekness and fear. Ultimately, our trust is in the Lord our God, who saves his anointed and hears us from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand. Therefore, take courage, for there is hope in Christ, and in him, we have the victory.

To build an extraordinary faith, we must seek the face of the Lord by studying His Word (1 Chronicles 16:11). The Word, which is Spirit, has the ability to reproduce itself in us. Meditate on the scriptures day and night and make the Word more than your necessary food (Psalm 1:2; Job 23:12). The Word must fill every fiber of your being (Colossians 3:16), so have an appetite, thirst, and hunger for it. The power of God's Word will enable you to remain unshakable and maintain your ground (Joshua 1:6-8). Make it a habit to speak in tongues, for the person who speaks in tongues builds and charges himself (1 Corinthians 14:4; Jude 1:20 AMP). Do not put so much confidence in human guards; see God as your total protection. We must walk by faith, not by sight, and not cast away our confidence, which has great reward (2 Corinthians 5:7; Hebrews 10:35).

With God, all things are possible. There are stories of men of God who have charged aircrafts to land safely during emergencies. The key is to not let the challenges of life dominate us. Instead, we should remember that we have been given power to overcome obstacles. Jesus said in Luke 10:19 that we have been given power to tread on serpents and scorpions and nothing shall hurt us. Mark 16:17-18 also states that signs will follow those who believe. We must be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might, just like Paul. Let us take advantage of the power given to us in Christ. God bless you.
