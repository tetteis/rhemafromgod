You have control over your own life and destiny, so it's important to speak the Word over yourself and not just rely on having a Bible nearby. The power of the Word comes from it being alive in you, so make sure to declare it over your life to deal with any situation. The story of Daniel shows how he used the Word to bring about change in his time (Daniel 9:1-19). Be careful about the words you speak, especially over your children. By speaking positively and confessing God's blessings over them, you can alter their future and bring about positive change. This is supported by the Jewish tradition of mothers speaking blessings over their children, which resulted in their prosperity. So as a parent, speak only positive words over your children and watch them flourish.

Speak positively about the Church and declare that things are working out right. Be specific when making faith proclamations and ask for what you want from God. Claim what you need and do not accept substitutes from the devil. Speak to specific problems you are dealing with and know that it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. We are no longer servants but have come into a kingly state as supernatural beings from the heavenly lineage. Our mouths are not just for eating and drinking, but also for charting the course of our lives.

Psalm 8:4-5 states, "What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour." However, some translations show that the Hebrew word used in place of "angels" is Elohim, which is also the name of God. This means that man was made a little lower than God Himself, as he was created in God's image and given authority to rule over the earth (Genesis 1:26, 28). Through the new birth, believers have been given the lost authority that was originally given to Adam. We need to renew our minds with the Word of God, and meditate on it day and night to build our faith (Romans 12:2). Speaking the Word of God is essential in developing faith, and we must confess and mutter it to ourselves until it becomes our reality (Joshua 1:8). Faith is calling something into existence as though it already exists, just as God does (Romans 4:17).

Meditation is not simply cogitation. As believers, we must acknowledge that the Almighty God dwells within us, and by doing so, we can walk in dominion. We need to renew our minds with the Word of God, or we will become canal Christians. Renewing our minds is training ourselves to think in line with God's Word. We must use the Word of God as our weapon and speak it out loud because the Word of God is living and powerful (Ephesians 6:17). We need to know what we have in Christ and speak it out loud to ourselves. Satan has been defeated by Jesus, and as Christians, we have received the victory through Him (Colossians 2:15; John 16:33). By accepting Jesus Christ, we have been identified with Him and credited with everything He did for us. We no longer live under the dominion of Satan.

God changed Abraham's name from Abram to Abraham and his wife's name from Sarai to Sarah, and He promised Abraham a prosperous future. However, it was up to Abraham to walk in the light of this promise and build the life he desired (2 Corinthians 5:7). It's crucial to study the Word of God and know it for ourselves because it reveals what our lives should be like (2 Corinthians 3:18). Declare what the Word of God says concerning your situation and reject wrong names from men. Paint a clear picture of your desired outcome in your mind and speak it into existence. Keep talking about your future and don't give in to negative things others say about you. Walk by faith and not by sight, and keep declaring your confessions until they come to pass (2 Corinthians 5:7).

Pastor Kenneth E. Hagin declared that Daniel had favor with the prince of the eunuchs and asked God for favor with every teacher. He stood at the head of the class, being the only one with straight-A's, and could recite a chapter of a history book without memorizing it. He stated that he accomplished this by looking to his spirit, which is often neglected.

It's important to develop our human spirits instead of solely focusing on improving our memory. As believers, we have much to do, and there are places to go. We've only touched the edge of the believer's authority in Christ. We can use our words to program ourselves for a successful life or a life full of grief and regret. We have the right to claim what's been made available to us in Christ Jesus. Don't be afraid to claim what belongs to you. Dominate everywhere you go with faith-filled words. Keep talking the Word!
