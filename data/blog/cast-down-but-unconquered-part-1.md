The past months of the beginning of this year 2020 has seen every part of the world struggling with an outbreak called Coronavirus (COVID-19). Though it started in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, the intensity and impact of this virus has been strongly felt by various countries through the early months of 2020 till date (March 2020). It is a hard time for almost every country on the surface of the earth.

According to Worldometer, as of today, Tuesday 31st March 2020, as I write this mini booklet, some 854,307 people have been confirmed infected with the virus around the world, out of which 42,016 lives have been lost. Thanks be to God for the knowledge and wisdom He has blessed health workers and scientists with, today, we see recovered cases stand at 176,906.

My country, Ghana, as of today has recorded 161 confirmed positive cases, out of which 5 have died and 31 have recovered. Countries such as the United States of America, Italy, Spain, China, Germany, France, Iran and the United Kingdom combined are daily losing thousands of lives to this pandemic.

In a bid to contain and eradicate COVID-19, almost everything seems to have come to a halt. Companies, businesses, economies, borders, ports, and airports, among others have all shut down one way or the other. Not forgetting the temporary ban on all mass gatherings including religious bodies. Partial and total lockdowns are being introduced in most of these affected countries. I have not stepped out of my home for the past two days since a partial lockdown in some parts of Ghana was declared by our President.

These are indeed moments of gloom and doom, where all things look as if the train of life has entered an endless tunnel. Each passing day keeps us in the darkest moments of life. Though a sad and grieving time for many lives and countries, there is one thing we all cannot lose sight of. One thing which I will tell you soon.

A quote which has been attributed to the Italian Prime Minister in the wake of the spike in the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy goes as follows:

> We have lost control, we have killed the epidemic physically and mentally. Can't understand what more we can do; all solutions are exhausted on ground. Our only hope remains up in the sky, God rescue your people.

Whether he said this remains unclear, but the underlying bitter truth was well articulated in those words, which perhaps resonates with the thoughts in the minds and hearts of many others as well.

I come in a time as this with this mini booklet to encourage everyone out there that all hope is not lost. Yes, indeed our only hope now remains up there in the sky, and God will rescue us.

Be encouraged by God's Word in 2 Corinthians 4:8-9; "We are hard-pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed." Walk through this book with me as I share with you four (4) victories from the above scripture.

## THE FOUR (4) VICTORIES

### Victory 1

#### HARD PRESSED ON EVERY SIDE, YET NOT CRUSHED

This is why we have hope in spite of all the harm and troubles that we see the virus bringing our way. We are hard-pressed on every side - lives; finances; food; economies; transportation via the road, sea and air; companies; businesses; stock markets - but the good news is that WE ARE NOT CRUSHED. Of course, this is not a normal or mere pressing, it is indeed a hard and tough pressing. But then, as long as you are still alive, there is hope for you.

To be crushed is to be rendered into small, broken and disconnected fragments. Don't feel so, because you are not there at all. Don't see your end yet. God says you are only being pressed but you will not be crushed - you shall surely bounce back so powerful. From my earlier submission, you will realize that there has been a number of recovered cases with some of those who were infected. It is good news and of great relief, so come on, this is not the end of the world. Say to yourself, "I am not crushed, I am bouncing back bigger, better and greater in Jesus' name!"

### Victory 2

#### PERPLEXED, BUT NOT IN DESPAIR

To be perplexed means to be confused, baffled, puzzled or bewildered. It is no doubt that COVID-19 has brought about a whole lot of confusion in and around so many lives, countries, businesses, companies, economies, etc. Sadly, it was reported in the media that the German Finance Minister committed suicide amidst the troubles his country's economy is facing under his watch. That should tell you the intensity of bafflement and confusion the virus has aroused. So much is the mystery, uncertainties and pain this pandemic has become.

But once again, the good news still stands that amidst all of these happenings, we should not be in despair, says the LORD Almighty. To be in despair means, to give up beyond hope or expectation. It means to be hopeless; to have no hope; to give up all hope or expectation.

Good people out there, it's so clear by definition that the state of being in perplexity is never the same as that of being in despair. It is normal to get confused or puzzled but it is not normal to give up on ALL hope or expectation. The Finance Minister of Germany, yes, he was dumbfounded amidst all his knowledge in the financial world, but what if he had held on to other hopes and expectations? He would have lived perhaps.

"For there is hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender shoots will not cease. Though its root may grow old in the earth, and its stump may die in the ground, yet at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant." (Job 14:7-9).

If you are reading this mini booklet today, read the following carefully: there are other hopes and expectations you have no idea of - hold on to your faith, don't give up now. COVID-19 will not kill you. Your state of confusion will be over soon. Everything is going to be alright in Jesus' mighty name.
