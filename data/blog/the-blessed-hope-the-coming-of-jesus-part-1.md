Death has been a problem since Adam's fall, and many have tried various practices to find a solution. However, only Jesus can give life and solve the problem of death (2 Corinthians 5:21). Adam and Eve sinned by eating from the tree of knowledge, causing a separation between God and man (Genesis 2:17; Genesis 3:1-6). God had a plan to solve this issue through Christ Jesus, who took on spiritual and physical death on the cross. Jesus went to hell and defeated the devil and his cohorts, making a public show of their defeat (Colossians 2:15). Jesus resurrected and has the keys to hell and death (Revelation 1:18).

Jesus is the source of life and hope for mankind. He is the bread of life (John 6:35; 48) and the Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6). Those who confess Him as Lord and Savior have eternal life (John 3:16; Romans 10:9-10). The angels asked Mary Magdalene and the other Mary why they were seeking the living among the dead (Luke 24:5), and similarly, many search for life in dead forms. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the only one who conquered death and is the Resurrection and the Life (John 11:25-26). Despite attempts to prevent His resurrection, Jesus rose from the dead and is alive. The same power that raised Him from the dead is in us (Romans 8:11).

After Jesus' resurrection, the guards were bribed by the priests to spread the false story that Jesus' disciples stole His body (Matthew 28:11-15).

At the crucifixion, the veil in the Temple was torn in two from top to bottom, signifying that God no longer dwells in buildings made by man, but now dwells in us (Matthew 27:51-54). The Shekinah glory now dwells in our hearts (John 17:22).

Jesus' resurrection is essential to our salvation and new birth (1 Corinthians 15:20-23). Before Jesus, everyone who died went to hell, with Abraham's bosom being a place of comfort compared to hell itself (Luke 16:22-23).

In Luke 16:19-31, the story of the rich man and Lazarus illustrates that trusting in wealth and not God leads to torment. Despite the rich man's plea to send Lazarus to warn his brothers, Abraham explains that they have Moses and the Prophets to guide them. Even if someone were to rise from the dead, those who do not listen to God's messengers will not believe. The message is to heed the words of God's messengers and avoid ending up in hell. After Jesus died and resurrected, He defeated Satan and freed the children of God in hell. The earthquake and raised tombs at the time of His resurrection demonstrate His victory over death (Matthew 27:51-53).

According to scripture, when Jesus died on the cross, an earthquake occurred, the dead rose from their graves and were recognized by the people in the city. This event frightened the guards who concluded that Jesus was the Son of God (Matthew 27:54). Believers go to heaven and unbelievers to hell, where they wait for the resurrection of their bodies. Jesus promised one of the criminals who was crucified with him that he would be with him in paradise that day. (Luke 23:39-43). Hell was not created for man, but for the devil and his cohorts. The loss of even one soul does not bring happiness to God (2 Peter 3:9) Jesus has given the authority back to the Church to preach the Gospel, cast out devils, and heal the sick, and this authority is manifested through the Church (Matthew 28:19-20; Mark 16:15-18).

Those who die in the Lord are blessed and will rest from their labors, as revealed in Revelation 14:13. Our actions on earth follow us to heaven, where we will be rewarded for our contribution to the Kingdom of God. Fear not, as all of God's people will enter heaven and have a place reserved for them. This inheritance is incorruptible, undefiled, and reserved in heaven for us, kept by God's power through faith unto salvation. Our faith, tested through trials, will bring praise and glory to Jesus Christ. (1 Peter 1:3-9)

Praise God! Jesus said, "Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed" (John 20:29). Do you believe that Jesus died for you? If yes, then you are blessed! We need these blessings here on earth, not just in heaven. Jesus ascended into heaven with the saints that had already died, and He will come again as certainly as He left (Acts 1:8-11). We have a blessed hope! If you have received the Holy Ghost, then you have power to cause changes in your life. The return of Christ is our blessed hope, and we comfort one another with these words (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18).

According to scripture, there will be a "catching away," also known as the Rapture. Those who have died in Jesus will be brought back to life, and we are to comfort those who mourn. As believers, we have the Holy Ghost as our Comforter, Counselor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener, and Standby (John 14:16). We can bring comfort to others through the comfort we ourselves receive from God (2 Corinthians 1:3-5). When Jesus returns, He will come back with His saints, and we will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Therefore, we should not fear death, for as believers, we know that our labor is not in vain in the Lord, and we have victory through our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Corinthians 15:52-58).

Praise God! Though the saved Spirit battles worldly lusts in the body, Jesus' return will raise us incorruptible. In truth, we never die because we were raised with Christ and are united with Him (Ephesians 2:6; Colossians 2:12-14). As branches of the vine, we bear fruit with the same life flowing through us, making us conquerors (John 15:5; Romans 8:37; 1 John 4:4). Paul refers to the body sleeping, not the spirit (1 Corinthians 15:51).
