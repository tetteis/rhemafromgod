# Rhema From God

This project was bootstrapped with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

It's based on the Next.js [Starter Blog Template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog/wiki).

This project has been my all-time favorite because I have been able to maintain it since 2011, when I first learned to develop websites.

I've seen it evolve from [Facebook](https://facebook.com) posts to Google's [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com), then to [WordPress](https://wordpress.com), and now to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

It has survived many generations ðŸ˜…, and through it, I have gained a ton of experience migrating from project to project and solving all the challenges I encountered along the way.
